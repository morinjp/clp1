<p>\(f'(3)\) also does not exist.  One way to see this is to notice that the function is discontinuous here. More viscerally, note that \(f(3)=1\text{,}\) so as we take secant lines with one endpoint \((3,1)\text{,}\) and the other endpoint just to the right of \(x=3\text{,}\) we get slopes that are more and more strongly negative, as shown in the picture below. If we take the limit of the slopes of these secant lines as \(x\) goes to \(3\) from the right, we get \(-\infty\text{.}\) (This certainly doesn't match the slope from the left, which is \(-\frac{1}{4}\text{.}\))</p>
