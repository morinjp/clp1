<p>It is highly unlikely that you will ever need to explicitly construct such a  tree for any problem in the remainder of the text. The main point of  introducing these objects and working through a few examples is to realise that  all the functions that we will examine are constructed from simpler pieces. In  particular we have constructed all the above examples from simple “building  blocks”</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>constants — fixed numbers like \(1, \pi\) and so forth</li>
<li>variables — usually \(x\) or \(t\text{,}\) but sometimes other symbols</li>
<li>standard functions — like trigonometric functions (sine, cosine and  tangent), exponentials and logarithms.</li>
</ul>
<p>These simple building blocks are combined using arithmetic</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>addition and subtraction — \(a + b\) and \(a-b\)</li>
<li>multiplication and division — \(a \cdot b\) and \(\frac{a}{b}\)</li>
<li>raising to a power — \(a^n\)</li>
<li>composition — given two functions \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\) we form a  new function \(f(g(x))\) by evaluating \(y=g(x)\) and then evaluating \(f(y) =  f(g(x))\text{.}\)</li>
</ul>
<p>During the rest of the course when we learn how to compute limits and  derivatives, our computations require us to understand the way we construct  functions as we have just described.</p>
