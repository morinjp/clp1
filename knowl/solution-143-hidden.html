<body><div class="solution"><p>At the left end of the graph, \(f\) is decreasing rapidly, so \(f'\) is a strongly negative number. Then as we move towards \(x=0\text{,}\) \(f\) decreases less rapidly, so \(f'\) is a less strongly negative number. As we pass 0, \(f\) increases, so \(f'\) is a positive number. As we move to the right, \(f\) increases more and more rapidly, so \(f'\) is an increasing positive number. This description tells us that \(f'\) increases for the entire range shown. So (b) holds, but not (a) or (c). Since \(f'\) is negative to the left of the \(y\) axis, and positive to the right of it, also (d) and (e) do not hold.</p></div></body>
