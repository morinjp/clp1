<p>It is clear that limits of polynomials are very easy, while those of rational  functions are easy except when the denominator might go to zero. We have seen  examples where the resulting limit does not exist, and some where it does. We  now work to explain this more systematically. The following example demonstrates that it  is sometimes possible to take the limit of a rational function to a point at which the  denominator is zero. Indeed we must be able to do exactly this in order to be able to define derivatives in the next chapter.</p>
