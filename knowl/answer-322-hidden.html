<p>Let \(g(x):=\log(f(x))\text{.}\) Notice \(g'(x)=\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}\text{.}\)</p>
<p>In order to show that the two curves have horizontal tangent lines at the same values of \(x\text{,}\) we will show two things: first, that if \(f(x)\) has a horizontal tangent line at some value of \(x\text{,}\) then also \(g(x)\) has a horizontal tangent line at that value of \(x\text{.}\) Second, we will show that if \(g(x)\) has a horizontal tangent line at some value of \(x\text{,}\) then also \(f(x)\) has a horizontal tangent line at that value of \(x\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Suppose \(f(x)\) has a horizontal tangent line where \(x=x_0\) for some point \(x_0\text{.}\) This means \(f'(x_0)=0\text{.}\) Then \(g'(x_0)=\frac{f'(x_0)}{f(x_0)}\text{.}\) Since \(f(x_0) \neq 0\text{,}\) \(\frac{f'(x_0)}{f(x_0)}=\frac{0}{f(x_0)}=0\text{,}\) so \(g(x)\) also has a horizontal tangent line when \(x=x_0\text{.}\) This shows that whenever \(f\) has a horizontal tangent line, \(g\) has one too.</p>
<p>Now suppose \(g(x)\) has a horizontal tangent line where \(x=x_0\) for some point \(x_0\text{.}\) This means \(g'(x_0)=0\text{.}\) Then \(g'(x_0)=\frac{f'(x_0)}{f(x_0)}=0\text{,}\) so \(f'(x_0)\) exists and is equal to zero. Therefore, \(f(x)\) also has a horizontal tangent line when \(x=x_0\text{.}\) This shows that whenever \(g\) has a horizontal tangent line, \(f\) has one too.</p>
