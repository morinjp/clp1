<p>However, in our falling object example, the object is being acted on by  gravity and its speed is definitely not constant. Instead of asking for  <em class="emphasis">THE</em> velocity, let us examine the “average velocity” of the object over  a certain window of time. In this case the formula is very similar</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\text{average velocity } &amp;= \frac{\text{distance moved}}{\text{time taken}}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>But now I want to be more precise, instead write</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\text{average velocity } &amp;= \frac{\text{difference in} \text{ distance}}{\text{difference in time}}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Now in spoken English we haven't really changed much — the distance moved is  the difference in position, and the time taken is just the difference in time  — but the latter is more mathematically precise, and is easy to translate  into the following equation</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\text{average velocity } &amp;= \frac{s(t_2) - s(t_1)}{t_2 - t_1}.
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>This is the formula for the average velocity of our object between time \(t_1\)  and \(t_2\text{.}\) The denominator is just the difference between these times and the  numerator is the difference in position — i.e. position at time \(t_1\) is just  \(s(t_1)\) and position at time \(t_2\) is just \(s(t_2)\text{.}\)</p>
