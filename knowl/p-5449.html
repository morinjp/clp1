<p>To this point you have found solutions to equations almost exclusively by algebraic manipulation. This is possible only for the artificially simple equations of problem sets and tests. In the “real world” it is very common to encounter equations that cannot be solved by algebraic manipulation. For example, you found, by completing a square, that the solutions to the quadratic equation \(ax^2+bx+c=0\) are \(x=\big(-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}\big)/2a\text{.}\) But it is known that there simply does not exist a corresponding formula for the roots of a general polynomial of degree five or more. Fortunately, encountering such an equation is not the end of the world, because usually one does not need to know the solutions exactly. One only needs to know them to within some specified degree of accuracy. For example, one rarely needs to know \(\pi\) to more than a few decimal places. There is a whole subject, called numerical analysis, that concerns using algorithms to solve equations (and perform other tasks) approximately, to any desired degree of accuracy.</p>
