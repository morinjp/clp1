<ul class="disc">
<li>Let \(s(t)\) be the distance the stone has fallen \(t\) seconds after dropping it. Since the acceleration due to gravity is \(9.8\;\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}^2}\text{,}\) \(s''(t)=9.8\text{.}\) (We don't make this negative, because \(s(t)\) measures how far the stone has fallen, which means the positive direction in our coordinate system is “down”, which is exactly the way gravity is pulling.)</li>
<li>Then \(s'(t)\) has a constant derivative of 9.8, so \(s'(t)=9.8t+c\) for some constant \(c\text{.}\) Notice \(s'(0)=c\text{,}\) so \(c\) is the velocity of the stone at the very instant you dropped it, which is zero. Therefore, \(s'(t)=9.8t\text{.}\)</li>
<li>
<p>So, \(s(t)\) is a function with derivative \(9.8t\text{.}\) It's not too hard to figure out by guessing and checking that \(s(t)=\frac{9.8}{2}t^2+d\) for some constant \(d\text{.}\) Notice \(s(0)=d\text{,}\) so \(d\) is the distance the rock has travelled at the instant you dropped it, which is zero. So, \(s(t)=\frac{9.8}{2}t^2=4.9t^2\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Remark: this is exactly the formula found in Example <a knowl="./knowl/eg_fallingBallB.html" title="Example 3.1.2: Position and velocity from acceleration">3.1.2</a>. You may, in general, use that formula without proof, but you need to know where it comes from and be able to apply it in other circumstances where it might be slightly different--like part (b) below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rock falls for \(x\) seconds, so the distance fallen is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
4.9x^2 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Remark: this is a decent (if imperfect) way to figure out how deep a well is, or how tall a cliff is, when you're out and about. Drop a rock, square the time, multiply by 5.</p>
