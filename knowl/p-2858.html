<p>It is now easy to put together a mental image of your trajectory.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>For \(t\) large and negative (i.e. far in the past), \(x(t)\) is large and negative and \(v(t)\) is large and positive. For example <a knowl="./knowl/fn-109-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.1.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> , when \(t=-10^6\text{,}\) \(x(t)\approx t^3=- 10^{18}\) and \(v(t)\approx  3t^2 = 3\cdot 10^{12}\text{.}\) So you are moving quickly to the right.</li>
<li>For \(t \lt -1\text{,}\) \(v(t)=x'(t) \gt 0\) so that \(x(t)\) is increasing and you are moving to the right.</li>
<li>At \(t=-1\text{,}\) \(v(-1)=0\) and you have come to a halt at position \(x(-1)=(-1)^3-3(-1)+2=4\text{.}\)</li>
<li>For \(-1 \lt t \lt 1\text{,}\) \(v(t)=x'(t) \lt 0\) so that \(x(t)\) is decreasing and you are moving to the left.</li>
<li>At \(t=+1\text{,}\) \(v(1)=0\) and you have again come to a halt, but now at position \(x(1)=1^3-3+2=0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>For \(t \gt 1\text{,}\) \(v(t)=x'(t) \gt 0\) so that \(x(t)\) is increasing and you are again moving to the right.</li>
<li>For \(t\) large and positive (i.e. in the far future), \(x(t)\) is large and positive and \(v(t)\) is large and positive. For example <a knowl="./knowl/fn-110-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.1.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a> , when \(t=10^6\text{,}\) \(x(t)\approx t^3= 10^{18}\) and \(v(t)\approx  3t^2 = 3\cdot 10^{12}\text{.}\) So you are moving quickly to the right.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a sketch of the graphs of \(x(t)\) and \(v(t)\text{.}\) The heavy lines in the graphs indicate when you are moving to the right — that is where \(v(t)=x'(t)\) is positive.</p>
