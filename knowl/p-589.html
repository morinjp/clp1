<p>As \(x\) gets close to 0, the numerator is close to 1; the term \((3x^2-5)\) is negative; and the sign of \(x^3\) depends on the direction we're approaching 0 from. Since we're  dividing a numerator that is very close to 1 by something that's getting very close to 0, the magnitude of the fraction is getting bigger and bigger without bound. Since the sign of the fraction flips depending on whether we are using numbers slightly bigger than 0, or slightly smaller than 0, that means the one-sided limits are \(\infty\) and \(-\infty\text{,}\) respectively. (In particular, \(\displaystyle\lim_{x \rightarrow 0^-}\dfrac{x^2+2x+1}{3x^5-5x^3}=\infty\) and \(\displaystyle\lim_{x \rightarrow 0^+}\dfrac{x^2+2x+1}{3x^5-5x^3}=-\infty
\text{.}\)) Since the one-sided limits don't agree, the limit does not exist.</p>
