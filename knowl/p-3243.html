<p>Differential equations play a central role in modelling a huge number of  different phenomena, including the motion of particles, electromagnetic  radiation, financial options, ecosystem populations and nerve action potentials.  Most universities offer half a dozen different undergraduate courses on various  aspects of differential equations. We are barely going to scratch the surface  of the subject. At this point we are going to restrict ourselves  to a few very simple differential equations for which we can just  guess the solution. In particular, we shall learn how to solve systems obeying Newton's law of cooling in SectionÂ <a href="sec_newtonCooling.html" class="xref" title="Subsection 3.3.2: Newton's Law of Cooling">3.3.2</a>,  below. But first, here is another slightly simpler example.</p>
