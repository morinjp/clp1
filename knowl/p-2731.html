<p>Here is a sketch of the part of the graph very near \((1, -1)\text{.}\) The tangent line to the graph at \((1, -1)\) is also shown. Note that the tangent line is sloping down to the right, as we expect, and that the graph lies below the tangent line near \((1,-1)\text{.}\) That's because the slope \(f'(x)\) is decreasing (becoming more negative) as \(x\) passes through \(1\text{.}\)</p>
