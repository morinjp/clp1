<p>First, we need to note that \(f(x)\) is continuous (otherwise we can't use the IVT). Now, we need to find a value of \(x\) for which it is positive, and for which it's negative. By checking a few values, we find \(f(0)\) is positive, and \(f(100)\) is negative.  So, by the IVT, there exists a value of \(x\) (between \(0\) and \(100\)) for which \(f(x)=0\text{.}\) Therefore, there exists a value of \(x\) for which \(\sin x = x-1\text{.}\)</p>
