<div class="introduction">
<p>In this and following sections, we will ask you to approximate the value of several constants, such as \(\log(0.93)\text{.}\) A valid question to consider is why we would ask for approximations of these constants that take lots of time, and are less accurate than what you get from a calculator.</p>
<p>One answer to this question is historical: people were approximating logarithms before they had calculators, and these are some of the ways they did that. Pretend you're on a desert island without any of your usual devices and that you want to make a number of quick and dirty approximate evaluations.</p>
<p>Another reason to make these approximations is technical: how does the <em class="emphasis">calculator</em> get such a good approximation of \(\log(0.93)\text{?}\) The techniques you will learn later on in this chapter give very accurate formulas for approximating functions like \(\log x\) and \(\sin x\text{,}\) which are sometimes used in calculators.</p>
<p>A third reason to make simple approximations of expressions that a calculator could evaluate is to provide a reality check. If you have a ballpark guess for your answer, and your calculator gives you something wildly different, you know to double-check that you typed everything in correctly.</p>

<div class="introduction"><p>For now, questions like Question <a knowl="./knowl/s3_4_1startapprox.html" title="Exercise 3.4.11.2">3.4.11.2</a> through Question <a knowl="./knowl/s3_4_1endapprox.html" title="Exercise 3.4.11.4">3.4.11.4</a> are simply for you to practice the fundamental ideas we're learning.</p></div>
