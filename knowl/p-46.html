<p>It took mathematicians quite a long time to realise that there were numbers that could not be written as ratios of integers <a knowl="./knowl/fn-4-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.1.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a>. The first numbers that were shown to be not-rational are square-roots of prime numbers, like \(\sqrt{2}\text{.}\) Other well known examples are \(\pi\) and \(e\text{.}\) Usually the fact that some numbers cannot be represented as ratios of integers is harmless because those numbers can be approximated by rational numbers to any desired precision.</p>
