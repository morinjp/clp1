<p>All of you will have done some basic bits of set-theory in school. Sets, intersection, unions, Venn diagrams etc etc. Set theory now appears so thoroughly throughout mathematics that it is difficult to imagine how Mathematics could have existed without it. It is really quite surprising that set theory is a much newer part of mathematics than calculus. Mathematically rigorous set  theory was really only developed in the 19th Century — primarily by Georg Cantor <a knowl="./knowl/fn-5-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.2.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>. Mathematicians were using sets before then (of course), however they were doing so without defining things too rigorously and formally.</p>
