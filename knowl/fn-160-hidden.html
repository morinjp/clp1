<body><span class="footnote">A very common error of logic that people make is “Affirming the consequent”. “If P then Q” is true, then observe Q and conclude P — this is false. “If he is Shakespeare then he is dead” “That man is dead” “He must be Shakespeare”. Or you may have also seen someone use this reasoning: “If a person is a genius before their time then they are misunderstood.” “I am misunderstood” “So I must be a genius before my time”.</span></body>
