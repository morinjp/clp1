<p>A problem like this can sometimes derail people. Breaking it up into pieces isn't so hard, but when you actually do those pieces, you can get confused and forget why you are doing the calculations you're doing. If you find yourself in this situation, look back a few steps to remind yourself why you started the calculation you just did. It can also be helpful to write notes, like “We are trying to find \(\diff{V}{t}\text{.}\) We already know that \(\diff{V}{t} = ...\text{.}\) We still need to find \(a\text{,}\) \(b\text{,}\) \(\diff{a}{t}\) and \(\diff{b}{t}\text{.}\)”</p>
