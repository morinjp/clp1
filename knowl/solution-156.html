<p>When \(x\) is not equal to 2, then the function is differentiable-- the only place we have to worry about is when \(x\) is exactly 2.</p>
<p>In order for \(f\) to be differentiable at \(x=2\text{,}\) it must also be continuous at \(x=2\text{.}\) This forces \(x^2\big|_{x=2}=\big[ax+b\big]_{x=2}\) or</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
2a+b=4.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>In order for a limit to exist, the left- and right-hand limits must exist and be equal to each other. Since a derivative is a limit, in order for \(f\) to be differentiable at \(x=2\text{,}\) the left hand derivative of \(ax+b\) at \(x=2\) must be the same as the right hand derivative of \(x^2\) at \(x=2\text{.}\) Since \(ax+b\) is a line, its derivative is \(a\) everywhere. We've already seen the derivative of \(x^2\) is \(2x\text{,}\) so we need</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
a=2x\big|_{x=2}=4.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>So, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) that makes \(f\) differentiable everywhere are \(a=4\) and \(b=-4\text{.}\)</p>
