<p>Since \(b\) is a positive constant, \(\ds\lim_{t \to \infty}e^{bt}=\infty\text{.}\) Therefore:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\lim_{t \to \infty}P(t)&amp;=\lim_{t \to \infty} P(0)e^{bt}
=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}
0&amp;\mbox{ if }P(0)=0\\
\infty&amp;\mbox{ if }P(0) \gt 0
\end{array}\right.
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>If \(P(0)=0\text{,}\) then the model simply says “a population that starts with no individuals continues to have no individuals indefinitely,” which certainly makes sense. If \(P(0) \neq 0\text{,}\) then (since we can't have a negative population) \(P(0) \gt 0\text{,}\) and the model says “a population that starts out with some individuals will end up with any gigantically huge number you can think of, given enough time.” This one doesn't make so much sense. Populations only grow to a certain finite amount, due to scarcity of resources and such. In the derivation of the Malthusian model, we assume a constant net birth rate--that the birth and death rates (per individual) don't depend on the population, which is not a reasonable assumption long-term.</p>
