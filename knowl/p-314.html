<p>Up to this point we explored limits by sketching graphs or plugging values into  a calculator. This was done to help build intuition, but it is not really the  basis of a systematic method for computing limits. We have also avoided more formal approaches <a knowl="./knowl/fn-31-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.3.7"><sup> 7 </sup></a> since we do not have time in the course to go into  that level of detail and (arguably) we don't need that detail to achieve the  aims of the course. Thankfully we can develop a more systematic approach based  on the idea of building up complicated limits from simpler ones by examining how  limits interact with the basic operations of arithmetic.</p>
