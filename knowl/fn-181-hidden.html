<body><span class="footnote">Inflation means that prices of goods (typically) increase with time, and hence $100 now is worth more than $100 in 10 years time. The term “present value” is widely used in economics and finance to mean “the current amount of money that will have a specified value at a specified time in the future”. It takes inflation into account.  If the money is invested, it takes into account the rate of return of the investment.  We recommend that the interested reader do some search-engining to find out more.</span></body>
