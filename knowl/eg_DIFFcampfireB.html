<p>Let us now go back to our motivating campfire example. There we had</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
f(x) &amp;= \text{ temperature at position $x$}\\
x(t) &amp;= \text{ position at time $t$}\\
F(t) &amp;= f(x(t)) = \text{ temperature at time $t$}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>The chain rule gave</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
F'(t) &amp;= f'\big(x(t)\big) \cdot x'(t)
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Notice that the units of measurement on both sides of the equation agree â€” as indeed they must. To see this, let us assume that \(t\) is measured in seconds, that \(x(t)\) is measured in metres and that \(f(x)\) is measured in degrees. Because of this \(F(x(t))\) must also be measured in degrees (since it is a temperature).</p>
<p>What about the derivatives? These are rates of change. So</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>\(F'(t)\) has units \(\frac{\rm degrees}{\rm second}\text{,}\)</li>
<li>\(f'(x)\) has units \(\frac{\rm degrees}{\rm metre}\text{,}\) and</li>
<li>\(x'(t)\) has units \(\frac{\rm metre}{\rm second}\text{.}\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence the product</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
f'\big(x(t)\big) \cdot x'(t) &amp;
\text{ has units } = \frac{\rm degrees}{\rm metre} \cdot
\frac{\rm metre}{\rm second}
= \frac{\rm degrees}{\rm second}.
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>has the same units as \(F'(t)\text{.}\) So the units on both sides of the equation agree. Checking that the units on both sides of an equation agree is a good check of consistency, but of course it does not prove that both sides are in fact the same.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="subsection-30.html#eg_DIFFcampfireB">in-context</a></span>
