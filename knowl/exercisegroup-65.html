<p>In the 1950s, pure-bred wood bison were thought to be extinct. However, a small population was found in Canada. For decades, a captive breeding program has been working to increase their numbers, and from time to time wood bison are released to the wild. Suppose in 2015, a released herd numbered 121 animals, and a year later, there were 136 <a knowl="./knowl/fn-133-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.3.14"><sup> 14 </sup></a>. If the wood bison adhere to the Malthusian model (a big assumption!), and if there are no more releases of captive animals, how many animals will the herd have in 2020?</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading">

<p>A founding colony of 1,000 bacteria is placed in a petri dish of yummy bacteria food. After an hour, the population has doubled. Assuming the Malthusian model, how long will it take for the colony to triple its original population?</p></article><article class="exercise-like boxed"><h6 class="heading">

<p>A single pair of  rats comes to an island after a shipwreck. They multiply according to the Malthusian model. In 1928, there were 1,000 rats on the island, and the next year there were 1500. When was the shipwreck?</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading">

<p>A farmer wants to farm cochineals, which are insects used to make red dye. The farmer raises a small number of cochineals as a test. In three months, a test population of cochineals will increase from 200 individuals to 1000, given ample space and food.</p>
<p>The farmer's plan is to start with an initial population of \(P(0)\) cochineals, and after a year have \(1\,000\,000+P(0)\) cochineals, so that one million can be harvested, and \(P(0)\) saved to start breeding again. What initial population \(P(0)\) does the Malthusian model suggest?</p></article>
