<p>Again, like the two scenarios above, this theorem says something intuitively obvious. Consider — if you throw a ball straight up into the air and then catch it, at some time in between the throw and the catch it must be stationary. Translating this into mathematical statements, let \(s(t)\) be the height of the ball above the ground in metres, and let \(t\) be time from the moment the ball is thrown in seconds. Then we have</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
s(0) &amp;= 1 &amp; \text{we release the ball at about hip-height}\\
s(4) &amp;= 1 &amp; \text{we catch the ball $4s$ later at hip-height}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Then we know there is some time in between — say at \(t=c\) — when the ball is stationary (in this case when the ball is at the top of its trajectory). I.e.</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
v(c) = s'(c) &amp;= 0.
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Rolle's theorem guarantees that for any differentiable function that starts and ends at the same value, there will always be at least one point between the start and finish where the derivative is zero.</p>
