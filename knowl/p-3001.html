<p>There are several pieces of information in the statement:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The balloon is spherical</li>
<li>The volume is changing at a rate of \(13cm^3/sec\) — so we need variables for volume (in \(cm^3\)) and time (in \(sec\)). Good choices are \(V\) and \(t\text{.}\)</li>
<li>We are asked for the rate at which the radius is changing — so we need a variable for radius and units. A good choice is \(r\text{,}\) measured in \(cm\) — since volume is measured in \(cm^3\text{.}\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the balloon is a sphere we know <a knowl="./knowl/fn-116-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.2.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
V &amp;= \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Since both the volume and radius are changing with time, both \(V\) and \(r\) are implicitly functions of time; we could really write</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
V(t) &amp;= \frac{4}{3}\pi r(t)^3.
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>We are told the rate at which the volume is changing and we need to find the rate at which the radius is changing. That is, from a knowledge of \(\diff{V}{t}\text{,}\) find the related rate <a knowl="./knowl/fn-117-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.2.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> \(\diff{r}{t}\text{.}\)</p>
