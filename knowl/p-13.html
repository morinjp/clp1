<p>Each problem in this book is split into four parts: Question, Hint, Answer, and Solution. As you are working problems, resist the temptation to prematurely peek at the hint or to click through to the answers and solutions in the appendix! It's important to allow yourself to struggle for a time with the material. Even professional mathematicians don't always know right away how to solve a problem. The art is in gathering your thoughts and figuring out a strategy to use what you know to find out what you don't.</p>
