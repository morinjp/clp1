<p>Let \(E_n\) be the difference between the area of the polygon and the circle: \(E_n =  A(P_n)-A\) (see the left of the previous figure). By the previous point we know \(E_n \gt 0\text{.}\)  Now as we increase the number of sides, this difference becomes smaller. To be more  precise we will show</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
E_{2n} &amp; \leq \frac{1}{2} E_n.
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>The error \(E_n\) is made up of \(n\) “lobes”. In the centre-left of the previous figure we  draw one such lobe. Let \(L_n\) denote the area of one of these lobes, so \(E_n = nL_n\text{.}\)  In  the centre of the previous figure we have labelled this lobe carefully and also shown how  it changes when we create the polygon \(P_{2n}\text{.}\) In particular, the original lobe is  bounded by the straight lines \(\vec{ad}, \vec{af}\) and the arc \(\widehat{fbd}\text{.}\) We create  \(P_{2n}\) from \(P_n\) by cutting away the corner triangle \(\triangle aec\text{.}\) Accordingly the  lines \(\vec{ec}\) and \(\vec{ba}\) are orthogonal and the segments \(|bc|=|cd|\text{.}\)</p>
