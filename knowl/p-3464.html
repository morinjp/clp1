<p>A 25-year-old graduate of UBC is given $50,000 which is invested at 5% per year compounded continuously. The graduate also intends to deposit money continuously at the rate of $2000 per year. Assuming that the interest rate remains 5%, the amount \(A(t)\) of money at time \(t\) satisfies the equation</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\diff{A}{t}= 0.05 A+2000
\end{equation*}
</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Solve this equation and determine the amount of money in the account when the graduate is 65.</li>
<li>At age 65, the graduate will withdraw money continuously at the rate of \(W\) dollars per year. If the money must last until the person is 85, what is the largest possible value of \(W\text{?}\)</li>
