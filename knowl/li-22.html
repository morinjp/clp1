<p>Rational numbers â€” this is all numbers that can be written as the ratio of two integers. That is, any rational number \(r\) can be written as \(p/q\) where \(p,q\) are integers. We denote this collection by \(\mathbb{Q}\) standing for <em class="emphasis">quoziente</em> which is Italian for quotient or ratio. Now we finally have a set of numbers which is closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication and division (of course you still need to be careful not to divide by zero).</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_0_1.html#li-22">in-context</a></span>
