</h6>
<p>Show that the equation \(2x-1=\sin(x)\) has exactly 1 solution.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<p>Start with a rough sketch of each side of the equation</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:12.5%;margin-right:12.5%;"><div class="sbspanel" style="width:100%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="text/figs/rolle_sketch2.svg" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt=""></div></div></div>
<p>This seems like it should be true.</p>
</li>
<li>Notice that the problem we are trying to solve is equivalent to showing that the function<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
f(x) &amp;= 2x-1-\sin(x)
\end{align*}
</div>has only a single zero.</li>
<li>Since \(f(x)\) is the sum of a polynomial and a sine function, it is continuous and differentiable everywhere. Thus we can apply both the IVT and Rolle's theorem.</li>
<li>Notice that \(f(0)=-1\) and \(f(2) = 4-1-\sin(2) = 3-\sin(2) \geq 2\text{,}\) since \(-1\leq
\sin(2) \leq 1\text{.}\) Thus by the IVT we know there is at least one number \(c\) between \(0\) and \(2\) so that \(f(c)=0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>But our job is only half done — this shows that there is at least one zero, but it does not tell us there is no more than one. We have more work to do, and Rolle's theorem is the tool we need.</li>
<li>
<p>Consider what would happen if \(f(x)\) is zero in 2 places — that is, there are numbers \(a,b\) so that \(f(a)=f(b)=0\text{.}\)</p>
<ul class="circle">
<li>Since \(f(x)\) is differentiable everywhere and \(f(a)=f(b)=0\text{,}\) we can apply Rolle's theorem.</li>
<li>Hence we know there is a point \(c\) between \(a\) and \(b\) so that \(f'(c)=0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>But let us examine \(f'(x)\text{:}\)<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
f'(x) &amp;= 2- \cos x
\end{align*}
</div>Since \(-1\leq \cos x \leq 1\text{,}\) we must have that \(f'(x) \geq 1\text{.}\)</li>
<li>But this contradicts Rolle's theorem which tells us there must be a point at which the derivative is zero.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus the function cannot be zero at two different places — otherwise we'd have a contradiction.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We can actually nail down the value of \(c\) using the bisection approach we used in example <a knowl="./knowl/eg_bisection.html" title="Example 1.6.15: Using the bisection method">1.6.15</a>. If we do this carefully we find that \(c \approx
0.887862\dots\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="subsection-37.html#eg_2_13_2">in-context</a></span>
