<p>Recall that the derivative \(v'(a)\) is the (instantaneous) rate of change of the function \(v(t)\) at \(t=a\text{.}\) Suppose that you are walking on the \(x\)–axis and that \(x(t)\) is your \(x\)–coordinate at time \(t\text{.}\) Also suppose, for simplicity, that you are moving from left to right. Then \(v(t)=x'(t)\) is your velocity at time \(t\) and \(v'(a)=x''(a)\) is the rate at which your velocity is changing at time \(t=a\text{.}\) It is called your acceleration. In particular, if \(x''(a) \gt 0\text{,}\) then your velocity is increasing, i.e. you are speeding up, at time \(a\text{.}\) If \(x''(a) \lt 0\text{,}\) then your velocity is decreasing, i.e. you are slowing down, at time \(a\text{.}\) That's one interpretation of the second derivative.</p>
