<p><p><alert>Exercises — Stage 1</alert></p></p>
<p>The first category is meant to test and improve your understanding of basic underlying concepts. These often do not involve much calculation. They range in difficulty from very basic reviews of definitions to questions that require you to be thoughtful about the concepts covered in the section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><p><alert>Exercises — Stage 2</alert></p></p>
<p>Questions in this category are for practicing skills. It's not enough to understand the philosophical grounding of an idea: you have to be able to apply it in appropriate situations. This takes practice!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><p><alert>Exercises — Stage 3</alert></p></p>
<p>The last questions in each section go a little farther than “<em class="alert"><p><alert>Exercises — Stage 2</alert></p></em>”. Often they will combine more than one idea, incorporate review material, or ask you to apply your understanding of a concept to a new situation.</p>
