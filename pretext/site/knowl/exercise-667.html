<p>Suppose an algorithm, given an input with with \(n\) variables, will terminate in at most \(S(n)=5n^4-13n^3-4n+\log (n)\) steps. A researcher writes that the algorithm will terminate in <em class="emphasis">roughly</em> at most \(A(n)=5n^4\) steps. Show that the percentage error involved in using \(A(n)\) instead of \(S(n)\) tends to zero as \(n\) gets very large. What happens to the absolute error?</p>
<p>Remark: this is a very common kind of approximation. When people deal with functions that give very large numbers, often they don't care about the <em class="emphasis">exact</em> large number--they only want a ballpark. So, a complicated function might be replaced by an easier function that doesn't give a large relative error. If you would like to know more about the ways people describe functions that give very large numbers, you can read about “Big O Notation” in Section 3.6.3 of the CLP2 textbook.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="exercises-43.html#exercise-667">in-context</a></span>
