<body><span class="footnote">One needs to be very careful making statements about  infinity. At some point in our lives we get around to asking ourselves “what  is the biggest number”, and we realise there isn't one. That is, we can go on  counting integer after integer, for ever and not stop. Indeed the set of  integers is the first infinite thing we really encounter. It is an example of a  <em class="emphasis">countably infinite</em> set. The set of real-numbers is actually much bigger  and is <em class="emphasis">uncountably infinite</em>. In fact there are an infinite number of  different sorts of infinity! Much of the theory of infinite sets was  developed by Georg Cantor; we mentioned him back in Section <a href="sec_sets.html" class="xref" title="Section 0.2: Sets">0.2</a> and he is well  worth googling.</span></body>
