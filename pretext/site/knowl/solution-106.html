<p>The amount of the substance that will linger long-term is some positive number--the substance will stick around. One example of a substance that does this is the ink in a tattoo. (If the injection was of medicine, probably it will be metabolized, and \(\displaystyle\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} c(t)=0\text{.}\))</p>
<p>Remark: it actually doesn't make much sense to let \(t\) go to infinity: after a few million hours,  you won't even have a body, so what is \(c(t)\) measuring? Often when we use formulas in the real world, there is an understanding that they are only good for some fixed range. We often use the limit as \(t\) goes to infinity as a stand-in for the function's long-term behaviour.</p>
