<body><span class="footnote">We are applying the Intermediate Value Theorem here,  but we have neglected to verify the hypothesis that \(\log_{10} (a)\)  is a continuous function. Please forgive us â€” we could do this if we really  had to, but it would make a big mess without adding much understanding, if we were to do  so here in the text. Better to just trust us on this.</span></body>
