<p>So we have covered, sums, differences, products and quotients. This allows us  to compute derivatives of many different functions — including polynomials  and rational functions. However we are still missing trigonometric functions  (for example), and a rule for computing derivatives of compositions. These will  follow in the near future, but there are a couple of things to do before that  — understand where the above theorems come from, and practice using them.</p>
