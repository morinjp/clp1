<p>As they are used in this section, what is the difference between speed and velocity?</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading">

<p>Speed can never be negative; can it be zero?</p></article><article class="exercise-like boxed"><h6 class="heading">

<p>Suppose you wake up in the morning in your room, then you walk two kilometres to school, walk another two kilometres to lunch, walk four kilometres to a coffee shop to study, then return to your room until the next morning. In the 24 hours from morning to morning, what was your average velocity? (In CLP-1, we are considering functions of one variable. So, at this stage, think of our whole world as being contained in the \(x\)-axis.)</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h6 class="heading">

<p>Suppose you drop an object, and it falls for a few seconds. Which is larger: its speed at the one second mark, or its average speed from the zero second mark to the one second mark?</p></article><article class="exercise-like boxed"><h6 class="heading">
<span class="codenumber">5</span> </h6>
<p>The position of an object at time \(t\) is given by \(s(t)\text{.}\) Then its average velocity over the time interval \(t=a\) to \(t=b\) is given by \(\dfrac{s(b)-s(a)}{b-a}\text{.}\) Explain why this fraction also gives the slope of the secant line of the curve \(y=s(t)\) from the point \(t=a\) to the point \(t=b\text{.}\)</p></article><article class="exercise-like boxed"><h6 class="heading">
<span class="codenumber">6</span> </h6>
<p>Below is the graph of the position of an object at time \(t\text{.}\) For what periods of time is the object's velocity positive?</p>
