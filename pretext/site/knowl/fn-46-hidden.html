<body><span class="footnote">Often with big important useful theorems  like this one, writing out the full name again and again becomes tedious, so we  abbreviate it. Such abbreviations are okay provided the reader knows this is  what you are doing, so the first time you use an abbreviation you should let  the reader know. Much like we are doing here in this footnote: : “IVT” stands for “intermediate value theorem”, which is Theorem <a knowl="./knowl/thm_ivt.html" title="Theorem 1.6.12: Intermediate value theorem (IVT)">1.6.12</a>.</span></body>
