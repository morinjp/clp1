<p>Since \(\theta\) is an angle in a right triangle with hypotenuse \(1\) and adjacent side length \(1-h\text{,}\) \(\cos\theta = \frac{1-h}{1} =1-h\text{.}\) We want to conclude that \(\theta = \arccos(1-h)\text{,}\) but let's be a little careful: remember that the range of the arccosine function is angles in \([0,\pi]\text{.}\) We must be confident that \(0\le\theta\le\pi\) in order to conclude \(\theta = \arccos(1-h)\)--but clearly, \(\theta\) is in this range. (Remark: we could also have said \(\sin\theta=\frac{\sqrt{2h-h^2}}{1}\text{,}\) and so \(\theta = \arcsin\left(\sqrt{2h-h^2}\right)\text{.}\) This would require \(-\frac{\pi}{2}\leq \theta\leq\frac{\pi}{2}\text{,}\) which is true when \(h \lt 1\text{,}\) but false for \(h \gt 1\text{.}\) Since our problem asks about \(h=0.25\text{,}\) we could also use arcsine.)</p>
