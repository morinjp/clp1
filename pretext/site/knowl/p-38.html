<p>Natural numbers — These are the “whole numbers” 1,2,3,… that we learn first at about the same time as we learn the alphabet. We will denote this collection of numbers by the symbol “\(\mathbb{N}\)”. The symbol \(\mathbb{N}\) is written in a type of bold-face font that we call “black-board bold” (and is definitely <em class="emphasis">not</em> the same symbol as \(N\)). You should become used to writing a few letters in this way since it is typically used to denote collections of important numbers.  Unfortunately there is often some confusion as to whether or not zero should be included <a knowl="./knowl/fn-1-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.1.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>. In this text the natural numbers does not include zero.</p>
