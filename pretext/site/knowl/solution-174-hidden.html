<p>As usual, it is instructive to think about the definition of the derivative:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
P'(T) \amp= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0}\dfrac{P(T+h)=P(T)}{h} \approx \dfrac{P(T+1)-P(t)}{1} \\
\amp= P(T+1)-P(T)
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>This is the difference in population between two hypothetical populations, raised one degree in temperature apart. So, it is the number of extra individuals that exist in the hotter experiment (with the understanding that this number could be negative, as one would expect in conditions that are hotter than the bacteria prefer). So \(P'(T)\) is the number of bacteria added to the colony per degree.</p>
