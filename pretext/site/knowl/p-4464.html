<p>After studying the function \(f(x)\) as described above, we should compute its derivative \(f'(x)\text{.}\)</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Critical points — determine where \(f'(x)=0\text{.}\) At a critical point, \(f\) has a horizontal tangent.</li>
<li>Singular points — determine where \(f'(x)\) is not defined.  If \(f'(x)\) approaches \(\pm\infty\) as \(x\) approaches a singular point \(a\text{,}\) then \(f\) has a vertical tangent there when \(f\) approaches a finite value as \(x\) approaches \(a\) (or possibly approaches \(a\) from one side) and a vertical asymptote when \(f(x)\) approaches \(\pm\infty\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\) (or possibly approaches \(a\) from one side).</li>
<li>Increasing and decreasing — where is the derivative positive and where is it negative. Notice that in order for the derivative to change sign, it must either pass through zero (a critical point) or have a singular point. Thus neighbouring regions of increase and decrease will be separated by critical and singular points.</li>
</ul>
