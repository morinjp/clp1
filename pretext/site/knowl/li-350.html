<p>The heart of things — we explain this at length below, but for now we  will give a quick explanation. <em class="alert">Work on these two points. They are hard.</em></p>
<ul class="circle">
<li>
<em class="alert">for all \(\epsilon \gt 0\) there exists \(\delta  \gt 0\)</em> — It is  important we read this in order. It means that we can pick any positive number  \(\epsilon\) we want and there will always be another positive number \(\delta\)  that is going to make what ever follows be true.</li>
<li>
<em class="alert">if \(0 \lt |x-a| \lt \delta\) then \(|f(x)-L| \lt \epsilon\)</em> — From the  previous point we have our two numbers — any \(\epsilon  \gt 0\) then based on that  choice of \(\epsilon\) we have a positive number \(\delta\text{.}\) The current statement  says that whenever we have chosen \(x\) so that it is very close to \(a\text{,}\) then  \(f(x)\) has to be very close to \(L\text{.}\) How close it “very close”? Well  \(0 \lt |x-a| \lt \delta\) means that \(x\) has to be within a distance \(\delta\) of \(a\)  (but not exactly \(a\)) and similarly \(|f(x)-L| \lt \epsilon\) means that \(f(x)\) has  to  be within a distance \(\epsilon\) of \(L\text{.}\)</li>
