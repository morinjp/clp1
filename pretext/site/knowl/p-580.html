<p>First, we find \(\displaystyle\lim_{x \rightarrow -1}\dfrac{x^3+x^2+x+1}{3x+3}\text{.}\) When we plug in \(x=-1\) to the top and the bottom, both become zero. In a polynomial, where there is a root, there is a factor, so this tells us we can factor out \((x+1)\) from both the top and the bottom. It's pretty easy to see how to do this in the bottom. For the top, if you're having a hard time, one factoring method (of many) to try is long division of polynomials; another is to factor out \((x+1)\) from the first two terms and the last two terms. (Detailed examples of long division are given in Appendix A.16 and Examples 1.10.2 and 1.10.3 of the CLP-2 Integral Calculus text.)</p>
