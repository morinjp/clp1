<p>Remark: \(R(x)\) is the error in our approximation. As mentioned in the text, we almost never know \(R\) exactly, but we can give a bound. We don't need the tightest bound--just a reasonable one that is easy to calculate. If we were dealing with real functions and approximations, we might not know that \(|R(10)|=8\text{,}\) but if we knew it was at most 9, that would be a pretty decent approximation.</p>
