<p>Objects accelerate as they fall — their speed gets bigger and bigger. So in the entire first second of falling, the object is at its fastest at the one-second mark.  We have defined the average speed over a time interval to be \(\dfrac{\mbox{distance moved}}{\mbox{time taken}}\text{.}\) We do not yet know how to compute the distanced travelled by an object whose speed is not constant. But our intuition certainly says that the distance travelled is no more than the maximum speed times the time taken, so that the average speed is no larger that the maximum speed. In the next chapter we will verify that intuition mathematically. See Example <a knowl="./knowl/eg_mvtg.html" title="Example 2.13.7: MVT, speed and distance">2.13.7</a>. So the average speed will be a smaller number then the speed at the one-second mark, which is the maximum speed.</p>
