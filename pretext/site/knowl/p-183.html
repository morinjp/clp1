<p>We don't quite know how to find a line given just 1 point, however we do  know how to find a line passing through 2 points. So pick another point on the  curves whose coordinates are very close to \(P\text{.}\) Now rather than picking some  actual numbers, I am going to write our second point as \(Q = (1+h, (1+h)^2)\text{.}\)  That is, a point \(Q\) whose \(x\)-coordinate is equal to that of \(P\) plus a little  bit â€” where the little bit is some small number \(h\text{.}\)  And since this point  lies on the curve \(y=x^2\text{,}\) and \(Q\)'s x-coordinate is \(1+h\text{,}\) \(Q\)'s y-coordinate must  be \((1+h)^2\text{.}\)</p>
