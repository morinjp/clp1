<body><div class="solution"><p>Since \(f'(x) \lt 0\text{,}\) we need a decreasing function. This only applies to (ii), (iii), and  (v). Since \(f''(x) \gt 0\text{,}\) that means \(f'(x)\) is increasing, so the <em class="emphasis">slope</em> of the function must be increasing. In (v), the slope is constant, so \(f''(x)=0\)--therefore, it's not (v). In (iii), the slope is decreasing, because near \(a\) the curve is quite flat (\(f'(x)\) near zero) but near \(b\) the curve is very steeply decreasing (\(f'(x)\) is a large <em class="emphasis">negative</em> number), so (iii) has a negative second derivative. By contrast, in (ii), the line starts out as steeply decreasing (\(f'(x)\) is a strongly negative number) and becomes flatter and flatter (\(f'(x)\) nears 0), so \(f'(x)\) is increasing--in other words, \(f''(x) \gt 0\text{.}\) So, (ii) is the only curve that has \(f'(x) \lt 0\) and \(f''(x) \gt 0\text{.}\)</p></div></body>
