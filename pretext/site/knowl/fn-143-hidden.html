<body><span class="footnote">Furthermore when \(x\) is close to \(a\text{,}\) \((x-a)^k\) decreases very quickly as \(k\) increases, which often makes the "high \(k\)" terms in \(T_n(x)\) very small. This can be a considerable advantage when building up approximations by adding more and more terms.  If we were to rewrite  \(T_n(x)\) in the form \(\ds \sum_{k=0}^n b_k x^k\) the "high \(k\)" terms would typically not be very small when \(x\) is close to \(a\text{.}\)</span></body>
