<p>What we're asked to find is when</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
Q(t)&amp;=0\\
\end{align*}
<p class="intertext">That is,</p>
\begin{align*}
Ce^{-kt}&amp;=0
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>If \(C=0\text{,}\) then this is the case for all \(t\text{.}\) There was no isotope to begin with, and there will continue not being any undecayed isotope forever.</p>
<p>If \(C \gt 0\text{,}\) then since \(e^{-kt} \gt 0\text{,}\) also \(Q(t) \gt 0\text{:}\) so \(Q(t)\) is never 0 for any value of \(t\text{.}\) (But as \(t\) gets bigger and bigger, \(Q(t)\) gets closer and closer to 0.)</p>
<p>Remark: The last result is somewhat disturbing: surely at some point the last atom has decayed. The differential equation we use is a model that assumes \(Q\) runs continuously. This is a good approximation only when there is a very large number of atoms. In practice, that is almost always the case.</p>
