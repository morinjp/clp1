<p>Since \(f(0)\) is  closer to \(g(0)\) than it is to \(h(0)\text{,}\) you would probably want to estimate \(f(0) \approx g(0)=1+2\sin (1)\) if you had the means to efficiently figure out what \(\sin(1)\) is, and if you were concerned with accuracy. If you had a calculator, you could use this estimation. Also, later in this chapter we will learn methods of approximating \(\sin (1)\) that do not require a calculator, but they do require time.</p>
