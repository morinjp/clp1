<p>Let</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
g(x)=f''(x)=x^3+5x-20.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Then \(g'(x)=3x^2+5\text{,}\) which is always positive. That means \(g(x)\) is strictly increasing for all \(x\text{.}\) So, \(g(x)\) can change signs once, from negative to positive, but it can never change back to negative. An inflection point of \(f(x)\) occurs when \(g(x)\) changes signs. So, \(f(x)\) has <em class="emphasis">at most one</em> inflection point.</p>
<p>Since \(g(x)\) is continuous, we can apply the Intermediate Value Theorem to it. Notice \(g(3) \gt 0\) while \(g(0) \lt 0\text{.}\) By the IVT, \(g(x)=0\) for at least one \(x \in (0,3)\text{.}\) Since \(g(x)\) is strictly increasing, at the point where \(g(x)=0\text{,}\) \(g(x)\) changes from negative to positive. So, the concavity of \(f(x)\) changes. Therefore, \(f(x)\) has <em class="emphasis">at least one</em> inflection point.</p>
<p>Now that we've shown that \(f(x)\) has at most one inflection point, and at least one inflection point, we conclude it has exactly one inflection point.</p>
