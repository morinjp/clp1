<body><span class="footnote">An extremely interesting mathematician who is responsible for much of our understanding of infinity. Arguably his most famous results are that there are more real numbers than integers, and that there are an infinite number of different infinities. His work, though now considered to be extremely important, was not accepted by his peers, and he was labelled “a corrupter of youth” for teaching it. For some reason we know that he spent much of his honeymoon talking and doing mathematics with Richard Dedekind.</span></body>
