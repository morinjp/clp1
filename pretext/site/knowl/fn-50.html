</h6>The similar  (but uglier) formula for solving cubics took until the 15th century and the  work of del Ferro and Cardano (and Cardano's student Ferrari). A similar (but  even uglier) formula for quartics was also found by Ferrari. The extremely  famous  Abel-Ruffini Theorem (nearly by Ruffini in the late 18th century and  completely by Abel in early 19th century) demonstrates  that a similar formula  for the zeros of a quintic does not exist. Note that the theorem does  <em class="emphasis">not</em> say that quintics do not have zeros; rather it says that the zeros  cannot in general be expressed using a finite combination of addition,  multiplication, division, powers and roots. The interested student should also  look up Évariste Galois and his contributions to this area.</span><span class="incontext"><a href="subsection-9.html#fn-50">in-context</a></span>
