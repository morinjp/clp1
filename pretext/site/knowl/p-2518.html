<p>If the derivative of \(\arcsin(x)\) were given by \(\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{x^2-1}}\text{,}\) then the derivative of \(\arcsin(x)\) would not exist anywhere, so we would probably just write “derivative does not exist,” instead of making up a function with a mismatched domain. Also, the function \(f(x)=\arcsin(x)\) is a smooth curve--its derivative exists at every point strictly inside its domain. (Remember not all curves are like this: for instance, \(g(x)=|x|\) does not have a derivative at \(x=0\text{,}\) but \(x=0\) is strictly inside its domain.) So, it's a pretty good bet that the derivative of arcsine is <em class="emphasis">not</em> \(\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{x^2-1}}\text{.}\)</p>
