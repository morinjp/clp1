<p>From the given information,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
|R(10)|=|f(10)-F(10)|=|-3-5|=|-8|=8
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>So, (a) is false (since 8 is not less than or equal to 7), while (b), (c), and (d) are true.</p>
<p>Remark: \(R(x)\) is the error in our approximation. As mentioned in the text, we almost never know \(R\) exactly, but we can give a bound. We don't need the tightest bound--just a reasonable one that is easy to calculate. If we were dealing with real functions and approximations, we might not know that \(|R(10)|=8\text{,}\) but if we knew it was at most 9, that would be a pretty decent approximation.</p>
<p>Often in this section, we will make simplifying assumptions to get a bound that is easy to calculate. But, don't go overboard! It is a true statement to say that our absolute error is at most 100, but this statement would probably not be very helpful as a bound.</p>
