<p>We are to find the number of positive solutions to the equation \(e^x = 4\cos(2x)\text{.}\)  The figure below contains the graphs of \(y=e^x\) and \(y= 4\cos(2x)\text{.}\) The solutions to \(e^x =  4\cos(2x)\) are precisely the \(x\)'s where \(y=e^x\) and \(y= 4\cos(2x)\) cross.</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:17%;margin-right:17%;"><div class="sbspanel" style="width:100%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="problems/figs/graphExpCos.svg" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt=""></div></div></div>
<p>It sure looks like there is exactly one crossing with \(x\ge 0\) and that one crossing is somewhere between \(x=0\) and \(x=1\text{.}\) Indeed since \(\big[e^x- 4\cos(2x)\big]_{x=0} = -3 \lt 0\) and \(\big[e^x- 4\cos(2x)\big]_{x=1}  \gt  e  \gt  0\) and \(f(x)=e^x- 4\cos(2x)\) is continuous, the intermediate value theorem guarantees that there is at least one root with \(0 \lt x \lt 1\text{.}\)</p>
<p>We still have to show that there is no second root â€” even if our graphs are not accurate.</p>
<p>Recall that the range of the cosine function is \([-1,1]\text{.}\) If \(e^x=4\cos(2x)\text{,}\) then \(e^x \leq 4\text{,}\) so \(x \leq \log(4)\approx 1.39\text{.}\) So, we only need to search for roots of \(f(x)\) on the interval \((0,1.4)\text{:}\) we are guaranteed there are no roots elsewhere. Over this interval, \(2x \in (0,2.8)\text{,}\) so \(\sin(2x) \gt 0\text{,}\) and thus \(f'(x)=e^x+8\sin(2 x) \gt 0\text{.}\) Since \(f'(x)\) has no roots in \((0,1.4)\text{,}\) we conclude by Rolle's Theorem that \(f(x)\) has at most one root in \((0,1.4)\) (and so at most one positive root total). Since we've already found that a root of \(f(x)\) exists in \((0,1)\text{,}\) we conclude \(e^x=4\cos(2x)\) has precisely one positive-valued solution.</p>
