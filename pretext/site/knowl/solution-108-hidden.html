<p>If we let \(f\) be my height, the time of my birth is \(a\text{,}\) and now is \(b\text{,}\) then we know that \(f(a) \leq 1 \leq f(b)\text{.}\) It is reasonable to assume that my height is a continuous function. So by the IVT, there is some value \(c\) between \(a\) and \(b\) where \(f(c)=1\text{.}\) That is, there is some time (we called it \(c\)) between my birth and today when I was exactly one meter tall.</p>
<p>Notice the IVT does not say precisely what day I was one meter tall; it only guarantees that such a day occurred between my birth and today.</p>
