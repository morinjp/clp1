<p>To state this in terms of our first scenario back at the beginning of this section, suppose that you are driving along the \(x\)â€“axis. At time \(t=a\) you are at \(x=f(a)\) and at time \(t=b\) you are at \(x=f(b)\text{.}\) For simplicity, let's suppose that \(b \gt a\) and \(f(b)\ge
f(a)\text{,}\) just like in the above sketch.  Then during the time interval in question you travelled a net distance of \(f(b)-f(a)\text{.}\) It took you \(b-a\) units of time to travel that distance, so your average velocity was \(\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\text{.}\) You may very well have been going faster than \(\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\) part of the time and slower than \(\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\) part of the time. But it is reasonable to guess that at some time between \(t=a\) and \(t=b\) your instantaneous velocity was exactly \(\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\text{.}\) The mean value theorem says that, under reasonable assumptions about \(f\text{,}\) this is indeed the case.</p>
