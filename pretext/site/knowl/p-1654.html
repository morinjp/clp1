<p>Remember that we are trying to find an \(a\) with \(C(a)=1\text{.}\) We can do so by  recognising that  \(C(a)=C(10)\,(\log_{10}a)\) has the following properties.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>When \(a=1\text{,}\) \(\log_{10}(a) = \log_{10} 1 =0\) so that \(C(a) = C(10)  \log_{10}(a) = 0\text{.}\) Of course, we should have expected this, because when \(a=1\) we have \(a^x = 1^x = 1\) which is just the constant  function and \(\diff{}{x} 1 = 0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>\(\log_{10}a\) increases as \(a\) increases, and hence \(C(a)=C(10)\   \log_{10}a\) increases as \(a\) increases.</li>
<li>\(\log_{10}a\) tends to \(+\infty\) as \(a\rightarrow\infty\text{,}\) and hence \(C(a)\)  tends to \(+\infty\) as \(a\rightarrow\infty\text{.}\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence the graph of \(C(a)\) passes through \((1,0)\text{,}\) is always increasing as \(a\)  increases and goes off to \(+\infty\)  as \(a\) goes off to \(+\infty\text{.}\) See Figure <a knowl="./knowl/fig_CofA2.html" title="Figure 2.7.3">2.7.3</a>. Consequently <a knowl="./knowl/fn-74-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.7.5"><sup> 5 </sup></a> there is exactly one value of \(a\) for which \(C(a) = 1\text{.}\)</p>
