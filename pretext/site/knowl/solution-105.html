<p>First, we need a rational function whose limit at infinity is a real number. This means that the degree of the bottom is greater than or equal to the degree of the top. There are two cases: the denominator has higher degree than the numerator, or the denominator has the same degree as the numerator.</p>
<p>If the denominator has higher degree than the numerator, then \(\displaystyle\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} f(x)=\displaystyle\lim_{x \rightarrow -\infty} f(x)=0\text{,}\) so the limits are equal--not what we're looking for.</p>
<p>If the denominator has the same degree as the numerator, then the limit as \(x\) goes to \(\pm \infty\) is the ratio of the leading terms: again, the limits are equal. So no rational function exists as described.</p>
