</h6>Perhaps one of the most famous experiments in all of physics  is Galileo's leaning tower of Pisa experiment, in which he dropped two balls  of different masses from the top of the tower and observed that the time  taken to reach the ground was independent of their mass. This  disproved Aristotle's assertion that heavier objects fall faster. It is quite  likely that Galileo did not actually perform this experiment. Rather it was a  thought-experiment. However a quick glance at Wikipedia will turn up some  wonderful footage from the Apollo 15 mission showing a hammer and feather being  dropped from equal height hitting the moon's surface at the same time.  Finally, Galileo determined that the speed of falling objects increases at a  constant rate, which is equivalent to the formula stated here, but it is  unlikely that he wrote down an equation exactly as it is here.</span><span class="incontext"><a href="subsection-3.html#fn-22">in-context</a></span>
