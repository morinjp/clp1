</h6>Precise definitions aside, by “shorthand” we mean a collection of accepted symbols and abbreviations to allow us to write more quickly and hopefully more clearly. People have been using various systems of shorthand as long as people have been writing. Many of these are used and understood only by the individual, but if you want people to be able to understand what you have written, then you need to use shorthand that is commonly understood.</span><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_sets.html#fn-7">in-context</a></span>
