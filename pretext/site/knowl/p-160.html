<p>Finally we just need to redraw the sketch with the \(Y\) axis running vertically (with \(Y\) increasing upwards) and the \(X\) axis running horizontally (with \(X\) increasing to the right). To do so, pretend that the sketch is on a transparency or on a very thin piece of paper that you can see through. Lift the sketch up and flip it over so that the \(Y\) axis runs vertically and the \(X\) axis runs horizontally. If you want, you can also convert the upper case \(X\) into a lower case \(x\) and the upper case \(Y\) into a lower case \(y\text{.}\)</p>
