<p>According to Definition <a knowl="./knowl/def_DIFFderiv.html" title="Definition 2.2.1: Derivative at a point">2.2.1</a>, the derivative \(f'(a)\) exists precisely when the limit   \(\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow a} \frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}\) exists. That limit is also the slope of the tangent line to the curve \(y=f(x)\) at \(x=a\text{.}\) That limit does not exist when the curve \(y=f(x)\) does not have a tangent line at \(x=a\) or when the curve does have a tangent line, but the tangent line has infinite slope. We have already seen some examples of this.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>In Example <a knowl="./knowl/eg_DIFFderivXm1.html" title="Example 2.2.7: The derivative of \(f(x)=\tfrac{1}{x}\)">2.2.7</a>, we considered the  function \(f(x)=\frac{1}{x}\text{.}\) This function “blows up” (i.e.  becomes infinite) at \(x=0\text{.}\) It does not have a tangent line at  \(x=0\) and its derivative does not exist at \(x=0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>In Example <a knowl="./knowl/eg_diff_abs.html" title="Example 2.2.10: \(\diff{}{x} \left\{ |x| \right\}\)">2.2.10</a>, we considered the function  \(f(x)=|x|\text{.}\) This function does not have a tangent line at \(x=0\text{,}\)  because there is a sharp corner in the graph of \(y=|x|\) at \(x=0\text{.}\) (Look at the graph in Example 2.2.10.) So the derivative of \(f(x)=|x|\) does not exist at \(x=0\text{.}\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few more examples.</p>
