<p>The mean value theorem has hypotheses â€” \(f(x)\) has to be continuous for \(a\le x\le b\) and has to be differentiable for \(a \lt x \lt b\text{.}\) If either hypothesis is violated, the conclusion of the mean value theorem can fail. That is, the curve \(y=f(x)\) need not have a tangent line at some \(x=c\) between \(a\) and \(b\) whose slope, \(f'(c)\text{,}\) is the same as the slope, \(\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\text{,}\) of the secant joining the points \(\big(a\,,f(a)\big)\) and \(\big(b\,,f(b)\big)\) on the curve. If \(f'(x)\) fails to exist for even a single value of \(x\) between \(a\) and \(b\text{,}\) all bets are off. The following two examples illustrate this.</p>
