<p>Remark: this is a very common kind of approximation. When people deal with functions that give very large numbers, often they don't care about the <em class="emphasis">exact</em> large number--they only want a ballpark. So, a complicated function might be replaced by an easier function that doesn't give a large relative error. If you would like to know more about the ways people describe functions that give very large numbers, you can read about “Big O Notation” in Section 3.6.3 of the CLP2 textbook.</p>
