<p>In order to show that \(f(x)\) has <em class="emphasis">exactly one</em> inflection point, we will show that is has <em class="emphasis">at least one</em>, and <em class="emphasis">no more than one</em>.</p>
<p>Let</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
g(x)=f''(x)=x^3+5x-20.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Then \(g'(x)=3x^2+5\text{,}\) which is always positive. That means \(g(x)\) is strictly increasing for all \(x\text{.}\) So, \(g(x)\) can change signs once, from negative to positive, but it can never change back to negative. An inflection point of \(f(x)\) occurs when \(g(x)\) changes signs. So, \(f(x)\) has at most one inflection point. (At this point, we don't know that \(f(x)\) has any inflection points: maybe \(g(x)\) is always positive.)</p>
<p>Since \(g(x)\) is continuous, we can apply the Intermediate Value Theorem to it. Notice \(g(3) \gt 0\) while \(g(0) \lt 0\text{.}\) By the IVT, \(g(x)=0\) for at least one \(x \in (0,3)\text{.}\) Since \(g(x)\) is strictly increasing, at the point where \(g(x)=0\text{,}\) \(g(x)\) changes from negative to positive. So, the concavity of \(f(x)\) changes. Therefore, \(f(x)\) has at least one inflection point.</p>
<p>Now that we've shown that \(f(x)\) has at most one inflection point, and at least one inflection point, we conclude it has exactly one inflection point.</p>
