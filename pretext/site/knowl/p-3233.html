<p>Remark: the algebra in this problem got a little nasty, but the method behind its solution is no more difficult than most of the problems in this section. One of the reasons why calculus is so widely taught in universities is to give you lots of practice with problem-solving: taking a big problem, breaking it into pieces you can manage, solving the pieces, and getting a solution.</p>
