<p>This is a very typical example of a related rate problem. This section is really just a collection of problems, but all will follow a similar pattern.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The statement of the problem will tell you quantities that must be related (above it was volume, radius and, implicitly, time).</li>
<li>Typically a little geometry (or some physics orâ€¦) will allow you to relate these quantities (above it was the formula that links the volume of a sphere to its radius).</li>
<li>Implicit differentiation will then allow you to link the rate of change of one quantity to another.</li>
</ul>
