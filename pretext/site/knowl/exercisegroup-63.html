<p>Isaac Newton drinks his coffee with cream. To be exact, 9 parts coffee to 1 part cream. His landlady pours him a cup of coffee at \(95^\circ\) C into which Newton stirs cream taken from the icebox at \(5^\circ\) C. When he drinks the mixture ten minutes later, he notes that it has cooled to \(54^\circ\) C. Newton wonders if his coffee would be hotter (and by how much) if he waited until just before drinking it to add the cream. Analyze this question, assuming that:</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li>The temperature of the dining room is constant at \(22^\circ\) C.</li>
<li>When a volume \(V_1\) of liquid at temperature \(T_1\) is mixed with a volume \(V_2\) at temperature \(T_2\text{,}\) the temperature of the mixture is \(\dfrac{V_1T_1+V_2T_2}{V_1+V_2}\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Newton's Law of Cooling: The temperature of an object cools at a rate proportional to the difference in temperature between the object and its surroundings.</li>
<li>The constant of proportionality is the same for the cup of coffee with cream as for the cup of pure coffee.</li>

<p>The temperature of a glass of iced tea is initially \(5^\circ\text{.}\) After 5 minutes, the tea has heated to \(10^\circ\) in a room where the air temperature is \(30^\circ\text{.}\)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Use Newton's law of cooling to obtain a differential equation for the temperature \(T(t)\) at time \(t\text{.}\)</li>
