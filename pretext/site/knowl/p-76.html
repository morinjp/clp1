<p>When a set does not contain too many elements it is fine to specify it by listing out its  elements.  But for infinite sets or even just big sets we can't do this and instead we  have to give the defining rule. For example the set of all perfect square numbers we write as</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
S &amp;= \{x \st x = k^2 \mbox{ where } k \in \mathbb{Z} \}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Notice we have used another piece of shorthand here, namely \(\st\text{,}\) which stands for “such that” or “so that”. We read the above statement as “\(S\) is the set of elements \(x\) such that \(x\) equals \(k\)-squared where \(k\) is an integer”. This is the standard way of writing a set defined by a rule, though there are  several shorthands for “such that”. We shall use two them:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
P &amp;= \{ p \st p \mbox{ is prime} \} = \{ p \,|\, p \mbox{ is prime} \}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Other people also use “:” is shorthand for “such that”. You should recognise all  three of these shorthands.</p>
