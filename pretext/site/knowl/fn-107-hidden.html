<body><span class="footnote">This is because the equation \(ab=0\) is only satisfied for real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) when either \(a=0\) or \(b=0\) or both \(a=b=0\text{.}\) Hence if a polynomial is the product of two (or more) factors, then it is only zero when at least one of those factors is zero. There are more complicated mathematical environments in which you have what are called “zero divisors” but they are beyond the scope of this course.</span></body>
