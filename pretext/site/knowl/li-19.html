<p>Integers — all positive and negative numbers together with the number zero. We denote the collection of all integers by the symbol “\(\mathbb{Z}\)”. Again, note that this is not the same symbol as “\(Z\)”, and we must write it in the same black-board bold font. The \(\mathbb{Z}\) stands for the German <em class="emphasis">Zahlen</em> meaning numbers <a knowl="./knowl/fn-3-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.1.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a>. Note that \(\mathbb{Z}\) is closed under addition, subtraction and multiplication, but not division.</p>
<p>Two important subsets of integers are:</p>
<ul class="circle">
<li>Even numbers — an integer is even if it is exactly divisible by \(2\text{,}\) or equivalently if it can be written as the product of 2 and another integer. This means that \(-14, 6\) and \(0\) are all even.</li>
<li>Odd numbers — an integer is odd when it is not even. Equivalently it can be written as \(2k+1\) where \(k\) is another integer. Thus \(11 = 2\times 5+1\) and \(-7 = 2\times(-4)+1\) are both odd.</li>
