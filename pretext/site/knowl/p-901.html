<p>You are climbing the Grouse-grind <a knowl="./knowl/fn-47-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.6.5"><sup> 5 </sup></a> with a friend — call him Bob. Bob was eager and started at 9am. Bob,  while very eager, is also very clumsy; he sprained his ankle somewhere  along the path and has stopped moving at 9:21am and is just sitting <a knowl="./knowl/fn-48-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.6.6"><sup> 6 </sup></a> enjoying the  view. You get there late and start climbing at 10am and being quite fit you get to the  top at 11am. The IVT implies that at some time between 10am and 11am you  meet up with Bob.</p>
