<p>Population growth is rate of change of population. Population in year \(2000+t\) is given by \(P(t)=P_0+b(t)-d(t)\text{,}\) where \(P_0\) is the initial population of the town. Then \(P'(t)\) is the expression we're looking for, and \(P'(t)=b'(t)-d'(t)\text{.}\)</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the initial population does not obviously show up in this calculation. It would probably affect \(b(t)\) and \(d(t)\text{,}\) but if we know these we do not need to know \(P_0\) to answer our question.</p>
