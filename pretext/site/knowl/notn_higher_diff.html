<p>The following notations are all used for “the derivative of \(f(x)\) with respect to \(x\)”</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{gather*}
f'(x) \qquad
\diff{f}{x} \qquad
\diff{}{x}f(x) \qquad
\dot{f}(x) \qquad
Df(x) \qquad
D_x f(x),
\end{gather*}
</div>
<p>while the following notations are all used for “the derivative of \(f(x)\) at \(x=a\)”</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{gather*}
f'(a) \qquad
\diff{f}{x}(a) \qquad
\diff{}{x}f(x)\,\bigg|_{x=a} \qquad
\dot{f}(a) \qquad
Df(a) \qquad
D_x f(a).
\end{gather*}
</div>
<p>Some things to note about these notations:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>We will generally use the first three, but you should recognise  them all. The notation \(f'(a)\) is due to Lagrange, while the notation  \(\diff{f}{x}(a)\) is due to Leibniz. They are both very useful. Neither  can be considered “better”.</li>
<li>Leibniz notation writes the derivative as a “fraction” — however it  is definitely not a fraction and should not be thought of in that way. It is  just shorthand, which is read as “the derivative of \(f\) with respect to  \(x\)”.</li>
<li>You read \(f'(x)\) as “\(f\)–prime of \(x\)”, and \(\diff{f}{x}\) as “dee–\(f\)–dee–\(x\)”, and \(\diff{ }{x}f(x)\) as “dee-by-dee–\(x\) of \(f\)”.</li>
<li>Similarly you read \(\diff{f}{x}(a)\) as “dee–\(f\)–dee–\(x\) at \(a\)”, and \(\diff{  }{x}f(x)|_{x=a}\) as “dee-by-dee-\(x\) of \(f\) of \(x\) at \(x\) equals \(a\)”.</li>
<li>The notation \(\dot f\) is due to Newton. In physics, it is common  to use \(\dot f(t)\) to denote the derivative of \(f\) with respect to time.</li>
