<p>So far, we have evaluated derivatives only by applying  Definition <a knowl="./knowl/def_DIFFderiv.html" title="Definition 2.2.1: Derivative at a point">2.2.1</a> to the function at hand and then computing the  required limits directly. It is quite obvious that as the function being  differentiated becomes even a little complicated, this procedure quickly becomes  extremely unwieldy. It is many orders of magnitude more efficient to have  access to</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>a list of derivatives of some simple functions and</li>
<li>a collection of rules for breaking down complicated derivative computations into sequences of simple derivative computations.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is precisely what we did to compute limits. We started with limits of  simple functions and then used “arithmetic of limits” to computed limits of  complicated functions.</p>
