<body><span class="footnote">This is typical mathematician speak â€” it allows us to be completely correct, without being terribly precise. In this context, <em class="emphasis">sufficiently close</em> means <em class="emphasis">The following need not be true for all \(t\) bigger than \(c\text{,}\) but there must exist some \(b\gt c\) so that the following is true for all \(c\lt t\lt b\)</em>. Typically we do not know what \(b\) is. And typically it does not matter what the exact value of \(b\) is. All that matters is that \(b\) exists and is strictly bigger than \(c\text{.}\)</span></body>
