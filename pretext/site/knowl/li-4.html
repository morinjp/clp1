<p><em class="alert">Working with Friends:</em></p>
<p>Study buddies are fantastic! If you don't already have friends in your class, you can ask your neighbours in lecture to form a group. Often, a question that you might bang your head against for an hour can be easily cleared up by a friend who sees what you've missed. Regular study times make sure you don't procrastinate too much, and friends help you maintain a positive attitude when you might otherwise succumb to frustration. Struggle in mathematics is desirable, but suffering is not.</p>
<p>When working in a group, make sure you try out problems on your own before coming together to discuss with others. Learning is a process, and getting answers to questions that you haven't considered on your own can rob you of the practice you need to master skills and concepts, and the tenacity you need to develop to become a competent problem-solver.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="preface-2.html#li-4">in-context</a></span>
