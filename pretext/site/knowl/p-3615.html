<p>To proceed â€” assume we have proved our result for \(n=1,2,\cdots, k\text{.}\) We realise that we haven't done this yet, but bear with us. Using that assumption we will prove the result is true for \(n=k+1\text{.}\) Once we have done that, then</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>we have proved the result is true for \(n=1\text{,}\) and</li>
<li>we have shown if the result is true for \(n=k\) then it is true for \(n=k+1\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence it must be true for all \(n \geq 1\text{.}\) This style of proof is called mathematical induction. You can think of the process as something like climbing a ladder:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>prove that you can get onto the ladder (the result is true for \(n=1\)), and</li>
<li>if I can stand on the current rung, then I can step up to the next rung (if the result is true for \(n=k\) then it is also true for \(n=k+1\))</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence I can climb as high as like.</p>
