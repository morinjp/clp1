</h6>Given a statement of the form “If A then B”, the contrapositive is “If not B then  not A”. They are logically equivalent — if one is true then so is the  other. We must take care not to confuse the contrapositive with the converse.  Given “If A then B”, the converse is “If B then A”. These are definitely not the same. To see this consider the statement “If he is Shakespeare then he is dead.”  The converse is “If he is dead then he is Shakespeare” — clearly garbage  since there are plenty of dead people who are not Shakespeare. The  contrapositive is “If he is not dead then he is not Shakespeare” — which makes much more sense.</span><span class="incontext"><a href="subsection-4.html#footnote_contrapositive">in-context</a></span>
