<body><span class="footnote">Recall that speed and velocity are not the same. Velocity specifies the direction of motion as well as the rate of change. Objects moving along a straight line have velocities that are positive or negative numbers indicating  which direction the object is moving along the line. Speed, on the other hand, is the distance travelled per unit time and is always a non-negative number â€” it is the absolute value of velocity.</span></body>
