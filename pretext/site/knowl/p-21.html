<p>Questions outlined by a blue box make up the “RQS” <em class="emphasis">representative question set</em>. This set of questions is intended to cover the most essential ideas in each section. These questions are usually highly typical of what you'd see on an exam, although some of them are atypical but carry an important moral. If you find yourself unconfident with the idea behind one of these, it's probably a good idea to practice similar questions.</p>
