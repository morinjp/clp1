<p>This view of functions — a function is a formula — was how mathematicians defined them up until the 19th century. As basic ideas of sets became better defined, people revised ideas surrounding functions. The more modern definition of a  function between two sets is that it is a rule which assigns to each element of the first  set a unique element of the second set.</p>
