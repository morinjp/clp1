<p>The absence of such jumps leads to the following theorem which, while it can be  quite confusing on first glance, actually says something very natural â€”  obvious even. It says, roughly speaking, that, as you draw the graph \(y=f(x)\) starting at  \(x=a\) and ending at \(x=b\text{,}\) \(y\) changes continuously from \(y=f(a)\) to \(y=f(b)\text{,}\) with no  jumps, and consequently \(y\) must take every value between \(f(a)\) and \(f(b)\) at least once.  We'll start by just giving the precise statement and then we'll explain it in detail.</p>
