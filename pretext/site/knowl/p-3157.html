<p>We know something about the rate of change of the  height \(h\) of the triangle, and we want to know something about the rate of change of its area, \(A\text{.}\) A reasonable plan is to find an equation relating \(A\) and \(h\text{,}\) and differentiate implicitly with respect to \(t\text{.}\) The area of a triangle with height \(h\) and base \(b\) is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
A&amp;=\frac{1}{2}bh\\
\end{align*}
<p class="intertext">Note, \(b\) will change with time as well as \(h\text{.}\) So, differentiating with respect to time, \(t\text{:}\)</p>
\begin{align*}
\diff{A}{t}&amp;=\frac{1}{2}\left(\diff{b}{t}\cdot h+b\cdot\diff{h}{t}\right)
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>We are given \(\diff{h}{t}\) and \(h\text{,}\) but those \(b\)'s are a mystery. We need to relate them to \(h\text{.}\) We can do this by breaking our triangle into  two right triangles and using the Pythagorean Theorem:</p>
