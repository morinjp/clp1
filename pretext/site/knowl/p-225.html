<p>Suppose you wake up in the morning in your room, then you walk two kilometres to school, walk another two kilometres to lunch, walk four kilometres to a coffee shop to study, then return to your room until the next morning. In the 24 hours from morning to morning, what was your average velocity? (In CLP-1, we are considering functions of one variable. So, at this stage, think of our whole world as being contained in the \(x\)-axis.)</p>
