<p>From part <a knowl="./knowl/s2_11p2_1.html" title="Item 2.14.2.18.a">2.14.2.18.a</a>, the slope of the curve at \(x=1,\ y=2\) is \(\dfrac{4}{13}\text{,}\) so the curve is increasing, but fairly slowly. The angle of the tangent line is \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{13}\right)\approx 17^\circ\text{.}\) We are also told that \(y''(1) \lt 0\text{.}\) So the slope of the curve is decreasing as \(x\) passes through 1. That is, the line is more steeply increasing to the left of \(x=1\text{,}\) and its slope is decreasing (getting less steep, then possibly the slope even becomes negative) as we move past \(x=1\text{.}\)</p>
