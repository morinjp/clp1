<p>Computing tangent lines is all very well, but what does this have to do with  applications or the “Real World”? Well - at least initially our use of limits  (and indeed of calculus) is going to be a little removed from real world  applications. However as we go further and learn more about limits and  derivatives we will be able to get closer to real problems and their solutions.</p>
