<article class="listitem"><h6 class="heading"><span class="type">Item</span></h6>It is often (but not always) the case that, when \(f(x)\) has a local maximum at \(x=c\text{,}\) the function \(f(x)\) increases strictly as \(x\) approaches \(c\) from the left and decreases strictly as \(x\) leaves \(c\) to the right. That is, \(f'(x) \gt 0\) for \(x\) just to the left of \(c\) and \(f'(x) \lt 0\) for \(x\) just to the right of \(c\text{.}\) Then, it is often the case, because \(f'(x)\) is decreasing as \(x\) increases through \(c\text{,}\) that \(f''(c) \lt 0\text{.}\)</article><span class="incontext"><a href="ssec_maxmin.html#li-1226">in-context</a></span>
