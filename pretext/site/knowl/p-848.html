<p>Remark: it actually doesn't make much sense to let \(t\) go to infinity: after a few million hours,  you won't even have a body, so what is \(c(t)\) measuring? Often when we use formulas in the real world, there is an understanding that they are only good for some fixed range. We often use the limit as \(t\) goes to infinity as a stand-in for the function's long-term behaviour.</p>
