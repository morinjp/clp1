<p>Remark: In the text, you have already learned the derivatives of \(x^2\) and \(ax+b\text{.}\) In this question, you are only asked to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\)—not to justify how you got them—so you don't have to use the definition of the derivative. However, on an exam, you might be asked to justify your answer, in which case you would show how to differentiate the two branches of \(f(x)\) using the definition of a derivative.</p>
