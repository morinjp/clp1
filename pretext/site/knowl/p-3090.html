<p>Two tall sticks are vertically planted into the ground, separated by a distance of \(30\) cm. We simultaneously put two snails at the base of each stick. The two snails then begin to climb their respective sticks. The first snail is moving with a speed of \(25\) cm per minute, while the second snail is moving with a speed of \(15\) cm per minute. What is the rate of change of the distance between the two snails when the first snail reaches \(100\) cm above the ground?</p>
