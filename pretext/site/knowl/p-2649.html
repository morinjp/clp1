<p>Hence \(f'(c)=0\) only when \(c=\dfrac{-1}{2}\text{.}\) That the derivative only has a single zero is very useful. It means (via Rolle's theorem) that if \(f(x)\) has distinct roots \(a\) and \(b\) with \(a \lt b\text{,}\) then we must have \(a  \lt  \dfrac{-1}{2}  \lt  b\text{.}\)  This also means that \(f(x)\) cannot have 3 distinct roots \(a,b\) and (say) \(q\) with \(a \lt b \lt q\text{,}\) because then Rolle's theorem would imply that \(f'(x)\) would have two zeros â€” one between \(a\) and \(b\) and another between \(b\) and \(q\text{.}\)</p>
