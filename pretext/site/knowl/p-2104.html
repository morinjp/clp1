<p>Remark: The standard way to write this problem is to omit the notation \(f(x)\text{,}\) and let the variable \(y\) stand for two functions. When \(t\) is the variable, \(y(t)=\cos^2t\) gives the \(y\)-coordinate of the particle at time \(t\text{.}\) When \(x\) is the variable, \(y(x)\) gives the \(y\)-coordinate of the particle given its position along the \(x\)-axis. This is an abuse of notation, because if we write \(y(1)\text{,}\) it is not clear whether we are referring to the \(y\)-coordinate of the particle when \(t=1\) (in this case, \(y=\cos^2 (1) \approx 0.3\)), or the \(y\)-coordinate of the particle when \(x=1\) (in this case, looking at our table of values, \(y=0\)). Although this notation is not strictly “correct,” it is very commonly used. So, you might see a solution that looks like this:</p>
