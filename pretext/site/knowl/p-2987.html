<p>Now we need to think about your height as the trampoline is slowing your fall. One thing to remember about our general equation \(\frac{a}{2}t^2+vt+h\) is that \(v\) is the velocity when \(t=0\text{.}\) But, you don't hit the trampoline at \(t=0\text{,}\) you hit it at \(t=\frac{2}{9.8}\text{.}\) In order to keep things simple, let's use a <em class="emphasis">different</em> time scale for this second part of your journey. Let's let \(h_2(T)\) be your height at time \(T\text{,}\) from the moment your feet touch the trampoline skin (\(T=0\)) to the bottom of your fall. Now, we can use the fact that your initial velocity is \(-1\) metres per second (negative, since your height is decreasing) and your acceleration is \(4.9\) metres per second per second (positive, since your velocity is increasing from a negative number to zero):</p>

\begin{equation*}
h_2(T)=\frac{4.9}{2}T^2-T
\end{equation*}
