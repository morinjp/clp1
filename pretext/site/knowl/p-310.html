<ul class="disc">
<li>
<p>As \(x \to \pi\) from the left, \(\sin(x)\) is a small positive number that  is getting closer and closer to zero. That is, as \(x \to \pi^-\text{,}\) we have that  \(\sin(x) \to 0\) through positive numbers (i.e. from above). Now look at the graph  of \(1/x\text{,}\) and think what happens as we move \(x \to 0^+\text{,}\) the function is  positive and becomes larger and larger.</p>
<p>So as \(x \to \pi\) from the left, \(\sin(x) \to 0\) from above, and so \(1/\sin(x)  \to +\infty\text{.}\)</p>
</li>
<li>By very similar reasoning, as \(x \to \pi\) from the right, \(\sin(x)\) is a  small negative number that gets closer and closer to zero. So as \(x \to \pi\)  from the right, \(\sin(x) \to 0\) through negative numbers (i.e. from below) and so  \(1/\sin(x)\) to \(-\infty\text{.}\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x \to \pi^-} \frac{1}{\sin(x)} &amp;= +\infty &amp;
\lim_{x \to \pi^+} \frac{1}{\sin(x)} &amp;= -\infty
\end{align*}
