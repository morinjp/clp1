<p>(b) The volume of the bottle will be the area of its cross section times its height. This is always the case when you have some two-dimensional shape, and turn it into a three-dimensional object by “pulling” the shape straight up. (For example, you can think of a cylinder as a circle that has been “pulled” straight up. To understand why this formula works, think about what is means to measure the area of a shape in square centimetres, and the volume of an object in cubic centimetres.)</p>
