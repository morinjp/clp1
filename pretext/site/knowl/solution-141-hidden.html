<body><div class="solution"><p>The function shown is a line, so it has a constant slope--(a) . Since the function is always increasing, \(f'\) is always positive, so also (d) holds. Remark: it does not matter that the function itself is sometimes negative; the slope is always positive because the function is always increasing. Also, since the slope is constant, \(f'\) is neither increasing nor decreasing: it is the <em class="emphasis">function</em> that is increasing, not its derivative.</p></div></body>
