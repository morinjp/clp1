<p>The last piece of the puzzle is how long it took you to fall from the peak of your jump to the surface of the trampoline. We know the equation of your motion during that time: \(h_1(t)=\frac{-9.8}{2}t^2+t\text{.}\) You reached the peak when your velocity was zero:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
h_1'(t)=-9.8t+1 =0\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad t=\frac{1}{9.8}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>So, you fell from your peak at \(t=\frac{1}{9.8}\) and reached the level of the trampoline rim at \(t=\frac{2}{1.98}\text{,}\) which means the fall took \(\frac{1}{9.8}\) seconds.</p>
<p>Remark: by the symmetry mentioned early, the time it took to fall from the peak of your jump to the surface of the trampoline is the same as one-half the time from the moment you jumped off the rim to the moment you're back on the surface of the trampoline.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="exercises-20.html#li-805">in-context</a></span>
