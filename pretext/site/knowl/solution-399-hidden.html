<p>For this problem, remember that velocity has a sign indicating direction, while speed does not.</p>
<p>The velocity of the particle is given by \(h'(t)=3t^2-2t-5\text{.}\) At \(t=1\text{,}\) the velocity of the particle is \(-4\text{,}\) so the particle is moving downwards with a speed of 4 units per second. The acceleration of the particle is \(h''(t)=6t-2\text{,}\) so when \(t=1\text{,}\) the acceleration is (positive) \(4\) units per second per second. That means the velocity (currently \(-4\) units per second) is becoming a bigger number--since the velocity is negative, a bigger number is closer to zero, so the speed of the particle is getting smaller. (For instance, a velocity of \(-3\) represents a slower motion than a velocity of \(-4\text{.}\)) So, the particle is  slowing down at \(t=1\text{.}\)</p>
