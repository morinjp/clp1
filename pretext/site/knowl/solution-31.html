<li>As we saw in Question <a knowl="./knowl/s1_4zeroes1.html" title="Exercise 1.4.2.2">1.4.2.2</a>, \(x-3\) is a function with limit 0 at \(x=3\text{.}\)  So one way of thinking about this question is to try choosing \(f(x)\) so that  \(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=g(x)=x-3\) too, which leads us to the solution \(f(x)=(x-3)^2\) and \(g(x)=x-3\text{.}\) This is one of many, many possible answers.</li>
<li>Another way of thinking about this problem is that \(f(x)\) should go to 0 “more strongly” than \(g(x)\) when \(x\) approaches \(3\text{.}\) One way of a function going to 0 really strongly is to make that function identically zero. So we can set \(f(x)=0\) and \(g(x)=x-3\text{.}\) Now \(\dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)}\) is equal to 0 whenever \(x \neq 3\text{,}\) and is undefined at \(x=3\text{.}\) Since the limit as \(x\) goes to three does not take into account the value of the function at 3, we have \(\displaystyle\lim_{x \rightarrow 3} \dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)}=0\text{.}\)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many more possible answers.</p>
