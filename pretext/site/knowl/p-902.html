<p>You can translate this situation into the form of the IVT as follows. Let \(t\)  be time and let \(a = \) 10am and \(b=\) 11am. Let \(g(t)\) be your distance along the trail. Hence <a knowl="./knowl/fn-49-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.6.7"><sup> 7 </sup></a> \(g(a) = 0\) and  \(g(b) = 2.9km\text{.}\) Since you are a mortal, your position along the trail is a  continuous function — no helicopters or teleportation or… We have no idea  where Bob is sitting, except that he is somewhere between \(g(a)\) and  \(g(b)\text{,}\) call this point \(Y\text{.}\) The IVT guarantees that there is some time \(c\)  between \(a\) and \(b\) (so between 10am and 11am) with \(g(c) = Y\) (and your  position will be the same as Bob's).</p>
