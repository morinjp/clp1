<p>Again â€” this is a result we will come back to quite a few times in the future, so we  should make sure we can refer to it easily.  However, at present this statement only  holds  when \(n\) is a positive integer. With a little more work we can extend this to  compute \(x^q\) where \(q\) is any positive rational number and then any rational number at  all (positive or negative). So let us hold off for a little  longer. Instead we can make it a lemma, since it will be an ingredient in quite  a few of the examples following below and in constructing the final corollary.</p>
