<p>Real numbers — generally we think of these numbers as numbers that can be written as decimal expansions and we denote it by \(\mathbb{R}\text{.}\) It is beyond the  scope of this text to go into the details of how to give a precise definition of real numbers, and the notion that a real number can be written as a decimal expansion will be sufficient.</p>
<p>It took mathematicians quite a long time to realise that there were numbers that could not be written as ratios of integers <a knowl="./knowl/fn-4-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.1.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a>. The first numbers that were shown to be not-rational are square-roots of prime numbers, like \(\sqrt{2}\text{.}\) Other well known examples are \(\pi\) and \(e\text{.}\) Usually the fact that some numbers cannot be represented as ratios of integers is harmless because those numbers can be approximated by rational numbers to any desired precision.</p>
<p>The reason that we can approximate real numbers in this way is the surprising fact that between any two real numbers, one can always find a rational number. So if we are interested in a particular real number we can always find a rational number that is extremely close. Mathematicians refer to this property by saying that \(\mathbb{Q}\) is <em class="emphasis">dense</em> in \(\mathbb{R}\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_0_1.html#li-23">in-context</a></span>
