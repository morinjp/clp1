<p>If \(P'(t)\) is positive, your sample is below the ideal temperature, because adding heat increases the population. If \(P'(t)\) is negative, your sample is above the ideal temperature, because adding heat decreases the population. If \(P'(t)=0\text{,}\) then adding a little bit of heat doesn't change the population, but it's unclear why this is. Perhaps your sample is deeply frozen, and adding heat doesn't change the fact that your population is 0. Perhaps your sample is boiling, and again, changing the heat a little will keep the population constant at “none.” But also, at the ideal temperature, you would expect \(P'(t)=0\text{.}\) This is best seen by noting in the curve below, the tangent line is horizontal at the peak.</p>
