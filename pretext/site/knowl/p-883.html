<p>We just break things down into pieces and then put them back together keeping  track of where things might go wrong.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The function is a ratio of two pieces — so check if the numerator is  continuous, the denominator is continuous, and if the denominator might be zero.</li>
<li>The numerator is \(\sin(x)\) which is “continuous on its domain”  according to one of the above theorems. Its domain is all real  numbers <a knowl="./knowl/fn-43-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.6.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>, so it is  continuous everywhere. No problems here.</li>
<li>The denominator is the sum of \(2\) and \(\cos(x)\text{.}\) Since \(2\) is a constant  it is continuous everywhere. Similarly (we just checked things for the  previous point) we know that \(\cos(x)\) is continuous everywhere. Hence the  denominator is continuous.</li>
<li>So we just need to check if the denominator is zero. One of the facts  that we should know <a knowl="./knowl/fn-44-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.6.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> is that<div class="displaymath">
\begin{gather*}
-1 \leq \cos(x) \leq 1\\
\end{gather*}
<p class="intertext">and so by adding 2 we get</p>
\begin{gather*}
1 \leq 2+\cos(x) \leq 3
\end{gather*}
</div>Thus no matter what value of \(x\text{,}\) \(2+\cos(x) \geq 1\) and so cannot be zero.</li>
<li>So the numerator is continuous, the denominator is continuous and  nowhere zero, so the function is continuous everywhere.</li>
</ul>
