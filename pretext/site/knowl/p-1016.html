<p>This isn't the kind of equality that we can just solve; we'll need a trick, and that trick is the IVT. The general idea is to show that \(\sin x\) is somewhere bigger, and somewhere smaller, than \(x-1\text{.}\) However, since the IVT can only show us that a function is equal to a constant, we need to slightly adjust our language. Showing \(\sin x = x-1\) is equivalent to showing \(\sin x - x + 1 = 0\text{,}\) so let \(f(x)=\sin x - x +1\text{,}\) and let's show that it has a real root.</p>
