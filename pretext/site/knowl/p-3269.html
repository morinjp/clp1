<p>Before we worry about solving this equation, let's think a little about the sign of the  constant of proportionality. At any time \(t\text{,}\) there are three possibilities.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>If \(T(t) \gt A\text{,}\) that is, if the body is warmer than its surroundings, we would expect heat to flow from the body into its surroundings and so we would expect the body to cool off so that  \(\diff{T}{t}(t) \lt 0\text{.}\) For this  expectation to be consistent with equation <a knowl="./knowl/eq_newtonCooling.html" title="Equation 3.3.7: Newton's law of cooling">3.3.7</a>, we need \(K \lt 0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>If \(T(t) \lt A\text{,}\) that is the body is cooler than its surroundings, we would expect heat to flow from the surroundings into the body and so we would expect the body to warm up so that  \(\diff{T}{t}(t) \gt 0\text{.}\) For this  expectation to be consistent with equation <a knowl="./knowl/eq_newtonCooling.html" title="Equation 3.3.7: Newton's law of cooling">3.3.7</a>, we again need \(K \lt 0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Finally if \(T(t)=A\text{,}\) that is the body and its environment have the same temperature, we would not expect any heat to flow between the two and so we would expect that \(\diff{T}{t}(t)=0\text{.}\) This does not impose any condition on \(K\text{.}\)</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, we would expect \(K \lt 0\text{.}\) Of course, we could have chosen to call the constant of proportionality \(-k\text{,}\) rather than \(K\text{.}\) Then the differential equation would be  \(\diff{T}{t} = -k\big(T-A\big)\) and we would expect \(k \gt 0\text{.}\)</p>
