<p>Let's denote by \(P\) the initial deposit. Because the  interest rate is \(100 r\%\) per month, compounded monthly,</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>the first month's interest is \(P\times r\text{.}\) So at the end of month #1, the account balance is \(P+P\,r=P(1+r)\text{.}\)</li>
<li>The second month's interest is \([P(1+r)]\times r\text{.}\) So at the end of month #2, the account balance is \(P(1+r)+P(1+r)\,r=P(1+r)^2\text{.}\)</li>
<li>And so on.</li>
<li>So at the end of \(n\) months, the account balance is \(P(1+r)^n\text{.}\)</li>
</ul>
<p>In order for the balance at the end of \(n\) months, \(P(1+r)^n\text{,}\) to be $420, the initial deposit has to be \(P=420(1+r)^{-n}\text{.}\) That is what is meant by the statement “The present value<a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-181" id="fn-181"><sup> 5 </sup></a><span id="hk-fn-181" class="hidden-content tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">Inflation means that prices of goods (typically) increase with time, and hence $100 now is worth more than $100 in 10 years time. The term “present value” is widely used in economics and finance to mean “the current amount of money that will have a specified value at a specified time in the future”. It takes inflation into account.  If the money is invested, it takes into account the rate of return of the investment.
