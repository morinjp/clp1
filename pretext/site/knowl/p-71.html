<p>Now — if the set is a bit bigger then we might write something like this</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>\(C = \{1,2,3,\dots,40\}\) the set of all integers between 1 and 40 (inclusive).</li>
<li>\(A = \{1,4,9,16,\dots\}\) the set of all perfect squares <a knowl="./knowl/fn-9-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.2.5"><sup> 5 </sup></a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The “\(\dots\)” is again shorthand for the missing entries. You have to be careful with this as you can easily confuse the reader</p>
<ul class="disc"><li>\(B = \{3,5,7,\dots\}\) — is this all odd primes, or all odd numbers bigger than 1 or ?? What is written is not sufficient for us to have a firm idea of what the writer intended.</li></ul>
<p>Only use this where it is completely clear by context. A few extra words can save the reader (and yourself) a lot of confusion.</p>
