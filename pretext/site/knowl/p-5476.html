<p>We have now seen two procedures for finding roots of a function \(f(x)\) — the bisection method (which does not use the derivative of \(f(x)\text{,}\) but which is not very efficient) and Newton's method  (which does use the derivative of \(f(x)\text{,}\) and which is very efficient). In fact, there is a whole constellation of other methods<a knowl="./knowl/fn-184-hidden.html" title="Footnote C.2.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> and the interested reader should search engine their way to, for example, Wikipedia's article on root finding algorithms. Here, we will just mention two other methods, one being a variant of the bisection method and the other being a variant of Newton's method.</p>
