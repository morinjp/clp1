<body><span class="footnote">The polynomials are named after Brook Taylor who devised a general method for constructing them in 1715. Slightly later, Colin Maclaurin made extensive use of the special case \(a=0\) (with attribution of the general case to Taylor) and it is now named after him. The special case of \(a=0\) was worked on previously by James Gregory and Isaac Newton, and some specific cases were known to the 14th century Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama.</span></body>
