<p>For positive values of \(x\) closer to zero, we hope to find a positive value of \(f(x)\text{.}\) However, it's quite difficult to get a number \(c\) that obviously gives \(f(c) \gt 0\text{.}\) It suffices to observe that \(f(0)=0\) and \(f'(0)=2 \gt 0\text{.}\) From the definition of the derivative, we can conclude \(f(x) \gt 0\) for some \(x \gt 0\text{.}\) (If it is not true that \(f(x) \gt 0\) for some \(x \gt 0\text{,}\) then \(f(x)\le 0\) for all \(x \gt 0\text{.}\) The definition of the derivative tells us that [since \(f'(0)\) exists] \(f'(0)=\ds\lim_{h \to 0^+}\frac{f(h)-f(0)}{h}=\ds\lim_{h \to 0^+}\frac{f(h)}{h}\text{;}\) the denominator is positive, so if the numerator were always less than or equal to zero, the limit would be less than or equal to zero as well. However, the derivative is positive, so \(f(x) \gt 0\) for some \(x \gt 0\text{.}\)) Therefore, \(f(x)\) has a second root, so \(f(x)\) has precisely two roots.</p>
