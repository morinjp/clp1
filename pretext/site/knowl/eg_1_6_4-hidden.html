<body><article class="example-like"><p>You are climbing the Grouse-grind <a knowl="./knowl/fn-47-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.6.5"><sup> 5 </sup></a> with a friend — call him Bob. Bob was eager and started at 9am. Bob,  while very eager, is also very clumsy; he sprained his ankle somewhere  along the path and has stopped moving at 9:21am and is just sitting <a knowl="./knowl/fn-48-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.6.6"><sup> 6 </sup></a> enjoying the  view. You get there late and start climbing at 10am and being quite fit you get to the  top at 11am. The IVT implies that at some time between 10am and 11am you  meet up with Bob.</p>
<p>You can translate this situation into the form of the IVT as follows. Let \(t\)  be time and let \(a = \) 10am and \(b=\) 11am. Let \(g(t)\) be your distance along the trail. Hence <a knowl="./knowl/fn-49-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.6.7"><sup> 7 </sup></a> \(g(a) = 0\) and  \(g(b) = 2.9km\text{.}\) Since you are a mortal, your position along the trail is a  continuous function — no helicopters or teleportation or… We have no idea  where Bob is sitting, except that he is somewhere between \(g(a)\) and  \(g(b)\text{,}\) call this point \(Y\text{.}\) The IVT guarantees that there is some time \(c\)  between \(a\) and \(b\) (so between 10am and 11am) with \(g(c) = Y\) (and your  position will be the same as Bob's).</p></article></body>
