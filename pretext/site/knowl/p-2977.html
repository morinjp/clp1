<p>Remark: When acceleration is constant, the position function is a quadratic function, but we don't want you to get the idea that position functions are <em class="emphasis">always</em> quadratic functions--in the example you just did, it was the velocity function that was quadratic. Position, velocity, and acceleration functions don't have to be polynomial at all--it's only in this section, where we're dealing with the simplest cases, that they seem that way.</p>
