<p>Determine where they are continuous and discontinuous:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<p>When \(x \lt 1\) then \(f(x)\) is a straight line (and so a polynomial) and so it is  continuous at every point \(x \lt 1\text{.}\) Similarly when \(x \gt 1\) the function is a  straight line and so it is continuous at every point \(x \gt 1\text{.}\) The only point which  might be a discontinuity is at \(x=1\text{.}\) We see that the one sided limits are  different. Hence the limit at \(x=1\) does not exist and so the function is  discontinuous at \(x=1\text{.}\)</p>
<p>But note that that \(f(x)\) is continuous from one side â€” which?</p>
</li>
<li>The middle case is much like the previous one. When \(x \neq 0\) the \(g(x)\)  is a rational function and so is continuous everywhere on its domain (which is  all reals except \(x=0\)). Thus the only point where \(g(x)\) might be discontinuous is at  \(x=0\text{.}\) We see that neither of the one-sided limits exist at \(x=0\text{,}\) so the limit  does not exist at \(x=0\text{.}\) Hence the function is discontinuous at \(x=0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>
<p>We have seen the function \(h(x)\) before. By the same reasoning as  above, we know it is continuous except at \(x=1\) which we must check separately.</p>
<p>By definition of \(h(x)\text{,}\) \(h(1) = 0\text{.}\) We must compare this to the limit as \(x  \to 1\text{.}\) We did this before.</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\frac{x^3-x^2}{x-1} &amp;= \frac{x^2(x-1)}{x-1} = x^2
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>So \(\lim_{x  \to 1} \frac{x^3-x^2}{x-1} = \lim_{x  \to 1} x^2 = 1\neq h(1)\text{.}\) Hence \(h\)  is discontinuous at \(x=1\text{.}\)</p>
</li>
</ul>
