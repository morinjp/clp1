<p>At both points of interest, the point is moving along  a straight line. From the diagram, you can figure out the equation of that line.</p>
<p>For the question “How fast is the point moving?” in part (b), remember that the velocity of an object can be found by differentiating  (with respect to <em class="emphasis">time</em>) the equation that gives the position of the object. The complicating factors in this case are that (1) the position of our object is not given as a function of time, and (2) the position of our object is given in two dimensions, not one.</p>
