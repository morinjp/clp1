<p>We already know from our work above that polynomials are continuous, and that  rational functions are continuous at all points in their domains — i.e. where  their denominators are non-zero. As we did for  limits, we will see that continuity interacts “nicely” with arithmetic. This  will allow us to construct complicated continuous functions from simpler  continuous building blocks (like polynomials).</p>
