<p>Since \(f(x)\) is differentiable over all real numbers, it is also continuous over all real numbers. Similarly, \(f'(x)\) is differentiable over all real numbers, so it is also continuous over all real numbers, and so on for the first \(n\) derivatives of \(f(x)\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Rolle's Theorem tells us that if \(a\) and \(b\) are distinct roots of a function \(g\text{,}\) then \(g'(x)=0\) for some \(c\) in \((a,b)\text{.}\) That is, \(g'\) has a root strictly between \(a\) and \(b\text{.}\) Expanding this idea, if \(g\) has \(m+1\) distinct roots, then \(g'\) must have at least \(m\) distinct roots, as in the sketch below.</p>

<p>So, if \(f^{(n)}(x)\) has only \(m\) roots, then \(f^{(n-1)}(x)\) has at most \(m+1\) roots. Similarly, since \(f^{(n-1)}(x)\) has at most \(m+1\) roots, \(f^{(n-2)}(x)\) has at most \(m+2\) roots. Continuing in this way, we see \(f(x)=f^{(n-n)}(x)\) has at most \(m+n\) distinct roots.</p>
