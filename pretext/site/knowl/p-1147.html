<p>We had a glimpse of derivatives in the previous chapter on limits — in particular  Sections <a href="sec_first_lim.html" class="xref" title="Section 1.1: Drawing Tangents and a First Limit">1.1</a> and <a href="sec_velocity.html" class="xref" title="Section 1.2: Another Limit and Computing Velocity">1.2</a> on tangents and velocities introduced  derivatives in disguise. One of the main reasons that we teach limits is to understand  derivatives. Fortunately, as we shall see, while one does need to understand limits in  order to correctly understand derivatives, one does not need the full machinery of limits  in order to <em class="emphasis">compute and work with</em> derivatives. The other main part of calculus,  integration, we (mostly) leave until a later course.</p>
