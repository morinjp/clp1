<p>\(P(t)\) is an increasing function over its domain, so the population is increasing.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to see that \(P(t)\) is increasing.</p>
<p>What we really care about is whether \(e^{0.2t}\) is increasing or decreasing, since an increasing function multiplied by 100 is still an increasing function, and a decreasing function multiplied by 100 is still a decreasing function. Since \(f(t)=e^t\) is an increasing function, we can use what we know about graphing functions to see that \(f(0.2t)=e^{0.2t}\) is also increasing.</p>
